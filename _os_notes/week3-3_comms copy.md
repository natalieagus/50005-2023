Processes executing concurrently in the operating system may be either <span style="color:#f77729;"><b>independent</b></span> processes or <span style="color:#f77729;"><b>cooperating</b></span> processes:
* By default, processes are independent and isolated from one another (runs on its own virtual machine)
* A process is cooperating if it can affect or be affected by the other processes executing in the system. 

Processes need to cooperate due to the following possible <span style="color:#f77729;"><b>reasons</b></span>: 
1. Information sharing
2. Speeding up computations
3. Modularity (protect each segments) and convenience

Cooperating processes require Interprocess Communication <span style="color:#f77729;"><b>(IPC)</b></span> mechanisms -- these mechanisms are provided by or supported by the kernel. There are two ways to perform IPC:
1. <span style="color:#f77729;"><b>Shared Memory</b></span>
2. <span style="color:#f77729;"><b>Message Passing</b></span> (e.g: <span style="color:#f77729;"><b>sockets</b></span>)



## POSIX Shared Memory {#shared-memory}
Shared memory is a region in the RAM that can be <span style="color:#f77729;"><b>created</b></span> and shared among multiple processes using system call. 
1. Kernel <span style="color:#f7007f;"><b>allocates</b></span> and <span style="color:#f7007f;"><b>establishes</b></span> a region of memory and return to the caller process. 
2. Once shared memory is established, all accesses are treated as routine <span style="color:#f7007f;"><b>user memory accesses</b></span> for writing or reading to or from it, and <span style="color:#f7007f;"><b>no assistance from the kernel is required</b></span>.


### Procedure 
This section is here to enhance your understanding. You can skip this if you want.
{:.warning}

Both reader and writer get the shared memory identifier (an integer) using system call `shmget`. `SHM_KEY` is an integer that has to be unique, so any program can access what is inside the shared memory if they know the `SHM_KEY`. The Kernel will return the memory identifier associated with `SHM_KEY` if it is already created, or create it when it has yet to exist. The second argument: `1024`, is the size (in bytes) of the shared memory. 

```cpp
int shmid = shmget(SHM_KEY, 1024, 0666 | IPC_CREAT);
```

Then, both reader and writer should attach the shared memory onto its address space (i.e: map the allocated segment in physical memory to the VM space of the calling process). You can type cast the return of `shmat` onto any data type you want. In essence, `shmat` returns an address of your address space that translates to the shared memory block[^6]. 

```cpp
char *str = (char*) shmat(shmid, (void*)0, 0);
```

Afterwards, writer can write to the shared memory:
```cpp
sprintf(str, "Hello world \n");
```

Reader can read from the shared memory: 
```cpp
printf("Data read from memory: %s\n", str);
```

The figure below illustrates the steps above:
<img src="/50005/assets/images/week3/13.png"  class="center_full"/>

Once both processes no longer need to communicate, they can detach the shared memory from their address space:
```cpp
shmdt(str);
```


Finally, one of the processes can destroy it, typically the reader because it is the last process that uses it.  
```cpp
shmctl(shmid, IPC_RMID, NULL);
```


Of course one obvious issue that might happen here is that BOTH writer and reader are accessing the shared memory concurrently, therefore we will run into <span style="color:#f77729;"><b>synchronisation</b></span> problems whereby <span style="color:#f7007f;"><b>writer overwrites before reader finished reading</b></span> or <span style="color:#f7007f;"><b>reader attempts to read an empty memory value before writer finished writing</b></span>. 
{:.error}

We will address such synchronisation problems in the next chapter.  



### Program: IPC without SVC? {#code-ipc-is-impossible-without-system-calls}

Will the value of `shared_int` and `shared_float` be the same in the parent and child process?
{:.error}

```cpp
#include <sys/wait.h>
#include <sys/types.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <unistd.h>

int main(int argc, char const *argv[])
{
   pid_t pid;

   int shared_int = 10;

   static float shared_float = 25.5;

   pid = fork();

   if (pid < 0)
   {
       fprintf(stderr, "Fork has failed. Exiting now");
       return 1; // exit error
   }
   else if (pid == 0)
   {
       shared_int++;
       printf("shared_int in child process: %d\n", shared_int);
       shared_float = shared_float + 3;
       printf("shared_float in child process: %f\n", shared_float);
   }
   else
   {
       printf("shared_int in parent process: %d\n", shared_int);
       printf("shared_float in parent process: %f\n", shared_float);
       wait(NULL);
       printf("Child has exited.\n");
   }
   return 0;
}
```


### Program: IPC with Shared Memory (<span style="color:#f7007f;"><b>unsync</b></span>) {#code-ipc-with-shared-memory-unsync}

Parent and child processes can share the same segment, but we are faced with a <span style="color:#f7007f;"><b>synchronization</b></span> problem, something called “race condition” (next week’s material).

```cpp
#include <sys/wait.h>
#include <sys/types.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <unistd.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <sys/ipc.h>
#include <sys/shm.h>

int main(int argc, char const *argv[])
{
   pid_t pid;
   int *ShmPTR;
   int ShmID;

   /**
       This process asks for a shared memory of 4 bytes (size of 1 int) and attaches this
       shared memory segment to its address space.
    **/

   ShmID = shmget(IPC_PRIVATE, 1 * sizeof(int), IPC_CREAT | 0666);
   if (ShmID < 0)
   {
       printf("* shmget error (server) *\n");
       exit(1);
   }

   /**
       SHMAT attach the shared memory to the process
       This code is called before fork() so both parent
       and child processes have attached to this shared memory.

       Pointer ShmPTR contains the address to the shared memory segment.
    **/

   ShmPTR = (int *)shmat(ShmID, NULL, 0);

   if ((int)ShmPTR == -1)
   {
       printf("* shmat error (server) *\n");
       exit(1);
   }
   printf("Parent process has created a shared memory segment.\n");

   pid = fork();

   if (pid < 0)
   {
       fprintf(stderr, "Fork has failed. Exiting now");
       return 1; // exit error
   }
   else if (pid == 0)
   {
       *ShmPTR = *ShmPTR + 1; // dereference ShmPTR and increase its value
       printf("shared_int in child process: %d\n", *ShmPTR);
   }
   else
   {
       printf("shared_int in parent process: %d\n", *ShmPTR); // race condition
       wait(NULL); // move this above the print statement to see the change in ShmPTR value
       printf("Child has exited.\n");
   }
   return 0;
}
```

### Removing Shared Memory

In the code above, we didn’t detach and remove the shared memory, so it still persists in the system. Run the command `ipcs -m` to view it. To remove it, run the command `ipcrm -m [mem_id]`


## Message Passing {#message-passing-e-g-socket}

Message passing is a mechanism to allow processes to <span style="color:#f77729;"><b>communicate</b></span> and to <span style="color:#f77729;"><b>synchronize</b></span> their actions <span style="color:#f7007f;"><b>without sharing the same address space</b></span>. Every message passed back and forth between writer and reader (server and client) through message passing <span style="color:#f7007f;"><b>must be done using kernel’s help</b></span>. 


### Socket
Socket is one of message passing <span style="color:#f7007f;"><b>interfaces</b></span>. 
{:.warning}

A socket is one endpoint of a <span style="color:#f77729;"><b>two-way communication link</b></span> between two programs running on the network with the help of the **kernel**: 
* It is a <span style="color:#f77729;"><b>concatenation</b></span> of an IP address, e.g: 127.0.0.1 for localhost
* And <span style="color:#f77729;"><b>TCP</b></span> (connection-oriented) or <span style="color:#f77729;"><b>UDP</b></span> (connectionless) <span style="color:#f77729;"><b>port</b></span>, e.g: 8080. 
  * We will learn more about UDP and TCP as network communication protocols in the later part of the semester.
* When concatenated together, they form a <span style="color:#f77729;"><b>socket</b></span>, e.g: 127.0.0.1:8080
* All socket connection between two communicating processes must be <span style="color:#f77729;"><b>unique</b></span>.

    
For processes in the same machine as shown in the figure above, both processes communicate through a socket with IP `localhost` and a <span style="color:#f77729;"><b>unique</b></span>, unused port number. Processes can <code>read()</code>or <code>send()</code>data through the socket through system calls:
1. For example, when P1 tries to send a message (data) to P2 using socket, it has to copy the message from <span style="color:#f7007f;"><b>its own space</b></span> to the kernel space first through the socket via `write` system call. 
2. Then, when P2 tries to read from the socket, that message in the kernel space is copied again to P2’s space via `read` system call.

The diagram below illustrates how socket works in general:

<img src="/50005/assets/images/week3/14.png"  class="center_full"/>


### Program: IPC using Socket {#code-ipc-using-socket}
One process has to create a socket and listens for incoming connection. We call this process the <span style="color:#f77729;"><b>server</b></span>. After a listening socket is created, another process can connect to it. We call this process the <span style="color:#f77729;"><b>client</b></span>. 

Server process has to be run first, followed by the client process. The code below implements both versions: <span style="color:#f77729;"><b>blocking</b></span> and <span style="color:#f77729;"><b>non blocking</b></span> `read()`. Try blocking version, then nonblocking. 

<span style="color:#f77729;"><b>Server</b></span> program:

```cpp
#include <unistd.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <sys/socket.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <netinet/in.h>
#include <string.h>
#include <fcntl.h> /* Added for the nonblocking socket */

#define PORT 12345

int main(int argc, char const *argv[])
{
   int server_fd, new_socket, valread;
   int opt = 1;
   struct sockaddr_in address;
   int addrlen = sizeof(address);

   char buffer[1024] = {0};
   char *message = "Hello from server";

   // Creating socket, and obtain the file descriptor
   // Option:
   //      - SOCK_STREAM (TCP -- Week 11)
   //      - AF_INET (IPv4 Protocol -- Week 11)
   if ((server_fd = socket(AF_INET, SOCK_STREAM, 0)) == 0)
   {
       perror("socket failed");
       exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
   }

   // Attaching socket to  port 12345
   if (setsockopt(server_fd, SOL_SOCKET, SO_REUSEPORT,
                  &opt, sizeof(opt)))
   {
       perror("setsockopt");
       exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
   }
   address.sin_family = AF_INET;
   address.sin_addr.s_addr = INADDR_ANY;
   address.sin_port = htons(PORT);

   // Assign name to the socket
   /**
    When a socket is created with socket(2), it exists in a name
    space (address family) but has no address assigned to it.  bind()
    assigns the address specified by addr to the socket referred to
    by the file descriptor sockfd.  addrlen specifies the size, in
    bytes, of the address structure pointed to by addr.
    Traditionally, this operation is called "assigning a name to a
    socket".
   **/

   if (bind(server_fd, (struct sockaddr *)&address,
            sizeof(address)) < 0)
   {
       perror("bind failed");
       exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
   }

   // server listens for new connection (blocking system call)
   if (listen(server_fd, 3) < 0)
   {
       perror("listen");
       exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
   }

   // accept incoming connection, creating a 1-to-1 socket connection with this client
   if ((new_socket = accept(server_fd, (struct sockaddr *)&address,
                            (socklen_t *)&addrlen)) < 0)
   {
       perror("accept");
       exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
   }

   // Choose between blocking and nonblocking read
   // Blocking read
   valread = read(new_socket, buffer, 1024);

   // Nonblocking read
   // fcntl(new_socket, F_SETFL, O_NONBLOCK); /* Change the socket into non-blocking state */
   // valread = recv(new_socket, buffer, 1024, 0);

   printf("%s\n", buffer);
   send(new_socket, message, strlen(message), 0);
   printf("Hello message sent to client\n");
   return 0;
}
```

<span style="color:#f77729;"><b>Client</b></span> program:

```cpp
#include <unistd.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <sys/socket.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <netinet/in.h>
#include <string.h>
#include <fcntl.h> /* Added for the nonblocking socket */
#include <arpa/inet.h>

#define PORT 12345

int main(int argc, char const *argv[])
{
   struct sockaddr_in address;
   int sock = 0, valread;
   struct sockaddr_in serv_addr;

   char *message = "Hello from client";
   char buffer[1024] = {0};

   // create a socket
   if ((sock = socket(AF_INET, SOCK_STREAM, 0)) < 0)
   {
       printf("\n Socket creation error \n");
       return -1;
   }

   // fill block of memory 'serv_addr' with 0
   memset(&serv_addr, '0', sizeof(serv_addr));

   // setup server address
   serv_addr.sin_family = AF_INET;
   serv_addr.sin_port = htons(PORT);

   // Convert IPv4 addresses from text to binary form and store it at serv_addr.sin_addr
   if (inet_pton(AF_INET, "127.0.0.1", &serv_addr.sin_addr) <= 0)
   {
       printf("\nInvalid address/ Address not supported \n");
       return -1;
   }

   // connect to the socket with defined serv_addr setting
   if (connect(sock, (struct sockaddr *)&serv_addr, sizeof(serv_addr)) < 0)
   {
       printf("\nConnection Failed \n");
       return -1;
   }

   // send some data over
   send(sock, message, strlen(message), 0);
   printf("Hello message sent to server\n");

   // read from server back
   valread = read(sock, buffer, 1024);
   printf("%s\n", buffer);

   return 0;
}
```





### Message Queue 

<span style="color:#f77729;"><b>Message Queue </b></span>is just another <span style="color:#f77729;"><b>interface</b></span> for message passing (another example being socket as shown in the previous section). It uses system call `ftok, msgget, msgsnd, msgrcv` each time data has to be passed between the processes. [`msgrcv` and `msgsnd`](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/msgsnd.2.html) can be made <span style="color:#f77729;"><b>blocking</b></span> or <span style="color:#f77729;"><b>non blocking</b></span> depending on the setup. 

The figure below illustrates the general idea of Message Queue. The queue data structure is maintain by the Kernel, and processes may write into the queue at any time. If there are more than 1 writer and 1 reader at any instant, careful planning has to be made to ensure that the <span style="color:#f77729;"><b>right</b></span> message is obtained by the right process. 
<img src="/50005/assets/images/week3/week3cse-Page-7.drawio-2.png"  class="center_full"/>


<span style="color:#f77729;"><b>Writer</b></span> process program:

```cpp
// C Program for Message Queue (Writer Process)
#include <stdio.h>
#include <sys/ipc.h>
#include <sys/msg.h>
#define MAX 10

// structure for message queue
struct mesg_buffer 
{
   long mesg_type;
   char mesg_text[100];
} message;
 
int main()
{
   key_t key;
   int msgid;

   // ftok to generate unique key
   // key_t ftok (const char *pathname, int proj_id);
   // pathname to existing file, proj_id: any number
   // ftok uses the pathname and proj_id to create a unique value 
   // that can be used by different process to attach to shared memory 
   // or message queue or any other mechanisms.
   key = ftok("~/somefile", 128);

   // msgget creates a message queue
   // and returns identifier
   msgid = msgget(key, 0666 | IPC_CREAT);
   message.mesg_type = 1;

   printf("Write Data : ");
   fgets(message.mesg_text,MAX,stdin);
   
   // msgsnd to send message
   msgsnd(msgid, &message, sizeof(message), 0);
   
   // display the message
   printf("Data send is : %s \n", message.mesg_text);
  
   return 0;
}
```

<span style="color:#f77729;"><b>Reader</b></span> process program:

```cpp
// C Program for Message Queue (Reader Process)
#include <stdio.h>
#include <sys/ipc.h>
#include <sys/msg.h>

// structure for message queue
struct mesg_buffer
{
   long mesg_type;
   char mesg_text[100];
} message;

int main()
{
   key_t key;
   int msgid;

   // ftok to generate unique key
   key = ftok("~/somefile", 128);

   // msgget creates a message queue
   // and returns identifier
   msgid = msgget(key, 0666 | IPC_CREAT);

   // msgrcv to receive message
   msgrcv(msgid, &message, sizeof(message), 1, 0);

   // display the message
   printf("Data Received is : %s \n",
          message.mesg_text);

   // to destroy the message queue
   msgctl(msgid, IPC_RMID, NULL);

   return 0;
}
```


##  Message Passing vs Shared Memory {#comparison-between-message-passing-and-shared-memory}

1. <span style="color:#f77729;"><b>Number of system calls made:</b></span>

    * Message Passing, e.g: via socket requires <span style="color:#f7007f;"><b>system calls</b></span> for each message passed through `send() `and `receive()`but it is much quicker compared to shared memory to use if only small messages are exchanged.

    * Shared memory requires costly system calls (`shmget` and `shmat`) in the beginning to create the memory segment (this is very costly, depending on the size, pagetable update is required during attaching), but <span style="color:#f7007f;"><b>not afterwards</b></span> when processes are using them.<br>

2. <span style="color:#f77729;"><b>Number of procs using:</b></span>
    * Message passing is <span style="color:#f7007f;"><b>one-to-one</b></span>: only between two processes
  
    * Shared memory can be shared between <span style="color:#f7007f;"><b>many</b></span> processes.<br>
    
3. <span style="color:#f77729;"><b>Usage comparison:</b></span>
    * Message passing is useful for sending <span style="color:#f7007f;"><b>smaller</b></span> amounts of data between two processes, but if large data is exchanged then will suffer from system call overhead.
  
    * Shared memory is costly if only small amounts of data are exchanged. Useful for <span style="color:#f7007f;"><b>large</b></span> and frequent data exchange.<br>


4. <span style="color:#f77729;"><b>Synchronization mechanism:</b></span>
    * Message passing <span style="color:#f7007f;"><b>does not require any synchronisation</b></span> mechanism (because the Kernel will synchronise the two). It will block if required (but can be set to not be blocking too, i.e: block/not block if there’s no message to read but one process requests to read)
    
    * Shared memory requires <span style="color:#f7007f;"><b>additional synchronisation</b></span> to prevent <span style="color:#f7007f;"><b>race-condition</b></span> issues (burden on the developer). There’s no blocking support. It also has to be <span style="color:#f7007f;"><b>freed</b></span> after they are no longer needed, otherwise will persist in the system until its turned off (check for existing shared memories using `ipcs` in terminal)<br>


## Application: Chrome Browser Multi-process Architecture {#application-example-chrome-browser-multi-process-architecture}

Websites contain multiple <span style="color:#f77729;"><b>active</b></span> contents: Javascript, Flash, HTML etc to provide a rich and dynamic web browsing experience. You may <span style="color:#f77729;"><b>open</b></span> several tabs and <span style="color:#f77729;"><b>load</b></span> different websites at the same time. However, some web applications contain bugs, and may cause the entire browser to <span style="color:#f7007f;"><b>crash</b></span> if the entire Chrome browser is just <span style="color:#f7007f;"><b>one</b></span> single huge process. 

Google Chrome’s web browser was designed to address this issue by creating separate processes to provide <span style="color:#f77729;"><b>isolation</b></span>:
1. The Browser process (manages user interface of the browser (not website), disk and network I/O); only one browser process is created when Chrome is *just opened*
2. The Renderer processes to render web pages: a new renderer process is created for each website opened in a new tab 
3. The Plug-In processes for each type of Plug-In

All processes created by Chrome have to <span style="color:#f77729;"><b>communicate</b></span> with one another depending on the application. The advantage of such multi process architecture is that:
* Each website runs in <span style="color:#f7007f;"><b>isolation</b></span> from one another: if one website crashes, only its renderer crashes and the other processes are unharmed. 
* Renderer will also be unable to access the disk and network I/O directly (runs in sandbox: limited access) thus reducing the possibility of security <span style="color:#f7007f;"><b>exploits</b></span>. 
* Each process can be scheduled <span style="color:#f77729;"><b>independently</b></span>, providing <span style="color:#f7007f;"><b>concurency</b></span> and responsiveness. 



[^6]:
     Suppose process 1 and process 2 have successfully attached the shared memory segment.This attachment process causes this shared memory segment will be part of their address space, although the actual address could be different (_i.e._, the starting address of this shared memory segment in the address space of process 1 may be different from the starting address in the address space of process 2).
