## Java Object Mutex Lock

The Java programming language provides two basic synchronization idioms: synchronized <span style="color:#f77729;"><b>methods</b></span> and synchronized <span style="color:#f77729;"><b>statements</b></span>.

Each Java <span style="color:#f77729;"><b>object</b></span> has an associated binary <span style="color:#f77729;"><b>lock</b></span>:

- Lock is `acquired` by invoking a synchronized method/block
- Lock is `released` by exiting a synchronized method/block

With this lock, mutex is guaranteed for this object’s <span style="color:#f77729;"><b>method</b></span>; at most only one thread can be inside it at any time.
{:.error}

Threads <span style="color:#f77729;"><b>waiting</b></span> to acquire the object lock are waiting in the <span style="color:#f7007f;"><b>entry</b></span> set, status is still `blocked` and not runnable until it acquires the lock. Once the thread acquires the lock, it becomes `runnable`.

The wait set is NOT equal to the entry set -- it contains threads that are <span style="color:#f7007f;"><b>waiting for a certain condition (NOT WAITING FOR THE LOCK)</b></span>.

<img src="/50005/assets/images/week4/3.png"  class="center_seventy"/>

These sets (entry and waiting) are <span style="color:#f7007f;"><b>per object</b></span>, meaning each object instance only has <span style="color:#f77729;"><b>ONE</b></span> lock.

- Each object can have many synchronized methods.
- These methods share one lock.

### Synchronised Method (Anonymous)

Below is an example of how you can declare a synchronized method in a class. The mutex lock is <span style="color:#f7007f;"><b>itself</b></span> (`this`). The fact that we don't use other objects as a lock is the reason why we call this the <span style="color:#f77729;"><b>anonymous</b></span> synchronisation object.

```java
public synchronized returnType methodName(args)
{
       // Critical section here
       // ...
}
```

### Synchronised Statement using Named Object

And below is a synchronized block based on a <span style="color:#f77729;"><b>specific</b></span> named object (not `this` instance).

```cpp
Object mutexLock = new Object();
public returnType methodName(args)
{
   synchronized(mutexLock)
   {
       // Critical section here
       // ...
   }

   // Remainder section
}
```

You can also do a `synchronized(this)` if you'd like to use a synchronised statement anonymously.

## Java Static Locks

It is also possible to declare `static` methods as <span style="color:#f77729;"><b>synchronized</b></span>. This is because, along with the locks that are associated with object <span style="color:#f77729;"><b>instances</b></span>, there is a single class lock associated with <span style="color:#f77729;"><b>each</b></span> class.

The class lock has its own queue sets. Thus, for a given class, there can be several object locks, one per object instance. However, there is only one (static) class lock.
{:.warning}

# Java Condition Synchronization

Similarly, Java allows for condition synchronization using `wait()` and `notify()` method, as well as its own condition variables.

Example: suppose a few threads are trying to execute the same method as follows,

```java
public synchronized void doWork(int id)
{
   while (turn != id) // turn is a shared variable
   {
       try
       {
           wait();
       }
       catch (InterruptedException e)
       {
       }
   }
   // CRITICAL SECTION
   // ...
   turn = (turn + 1) % N;
   notify();
}
```

Suppose `N` threads are running this `doWork` function <span style="color:#f77729;"><b>concurrently</b></span> with argument `id` varying between `0` to `N-1`, i.e: 0 for thread 0, 1 for thread 1, and so on.

In this example, the condition in <span style="color:#f77729;"><b>question</b></span> is that ONLY thread whose `id == turn` can execute the CS.

When calling `wait()`, the lock for mutual exclusion <span style="color:#f77729;"><b>must</b></span> be held by the caller (same as the conditional variable in the section above). That's why the `wait` to the conditional variable is made inside a `synchronized` method. If not, disaster might happen, for example the following execution sequence:

- At `t=0`,
  - Thread Y check that `turn != id_y`, and then Y is suspended by the asynchronous timer.
- At `t=n`,
  - Thread X <span style="color:#f77729;"><b>resumes</b></span> and <span style="color:#f77729;"><b>increments</b></span> the `turn`. This causes `turn == id_y`.
  - Suppose X then calls `notify()`, and then X is suspended
- At `t=n+m`,
  - Thread Y <span style="color:#f77729;"><b>resumes</b></span> execution and enters `wait()`.
- However at this time, the value of `turn` is ALREADY `== id_y`.

We can say that thread Y <span style="color:#f7007f;"><b>misses</b></span> the `notify()` from X and might `wait()` forever. We need to make sure that BETWEEN the check of `turn` and the call of `wait()`, no OTHER THREAD can change the value of `turn`.
{:.error}

Since we MUST invoke `wait()` while holding a lock, it is important for `wait()` to <span style="color:#f77729;"><b>release</b></span> the object lock eventually (when the thread is waiting).
If you call another method to `sleep` such as `Thread.yield() `instead of `wait()`, then it <span style="color:#f7007f;"><b>will not</b></span> release the lock while waiting. This is <span style="color:#f77729;"><b>dangerous</b></span> as it will result in indefinite waiting or <span style="color:#f7007f;"><b>deadlock</b></span>.

Upon return from `wait()`, the Java thread would have <span style="color:#f77729;"><b>re-acquired</b></span> the mutex lock <span style="color:#f77729;"><b>automatically</b></span>.

In summary,

- When a thread calls the `wait()` method, the following happens:

  - The thread <span style="color:#f77729;"><b>releases</b></span> the lock for the object.
  - The state of the thread is set to <span style="color:#f77729;"><b>blocked</b></span>.
  - The thread is placed in the <span style="color:#f77729;"><b>wait set</b></span> for the object.

- When it calls `notify()`:
  - Picks an <span style="color:#f77729;"><b>arbitrary</b></span> thread T from the list of threads in the wait set
  - Moves T from the wait set to the <span style="color:#f77729;"><b>entry</b></span> set
  - The state of T will be changed from blocked to <span style="color:#f77729;"><b>runnable</b></span>, so it can be scheduled to reacquire the mutex lock

## NotifyAll

However we are not completely free of another <span style="color:#f77729;"><b>potential</b></span> problem yet: `notify()` might not wake up the <span style="color:#f77729;"><b>correct</b></span> thread whose `id == turn`, and recall that `turn` is a shared variable.

We can solve the problem using another method `notifyAll()`: wakes up all threads in the wait set.  
{:.warning}

## Wait in a Loop

It is <span style="color:#f77729;"><b>important</b></span> to put the waiting of a condition variable in a `while` loop due to the possibility of:

1. <span style="color:#f77729;"><b>Spurious</b></span> wakeup: a thread might get woken up even though no thread signalled the condition (`POSIX` does this for performance reasons)
2. <span style="color:#f77729;"><b>Extraneous</b></span> wakeup: you woke up the correct amount of threads but some hasn’t been scheduled yet, so some other threads do the job first. <span style="color:#f77729;"><b>For example:</b></span>
   - There are <span style="color:#f77729;"><b>two</b></span> jobs in a queue, and there’s two threads: thread A and B that got woken up.
   - Thread A gets <span style="color:#f77729;"><b>scheduled</b></span>, and finishes the first job. It then finds the second job in the queue, and <span style="color:#f77729;"><b>finishes</b></span> it as well.
   - Thread B finally gets scheduled and, upon finding the queue empty, crashes.

# Reentrant Lock

A lock is re-entrant if it is <span style="color:#f77729;"><b>safe</b></span> to be acquired <span style="color:#f77729;"><b>again</b></span> by a caller that’s <span style="color:#f77729;"><b>already holding the lock</b></span>. You can create a `ReentrantLock()` object explicitly to allow reentrancy in your critical section.
{:.warning}

Java synchronized methods and synchronized blocks with intrinsic lock (recall: every object has an intrinsic lock associated with it) <span style="color:#f7007f;"><b>are reentrant</b></span>.

For example, a thread can safely <span style="color:#f77729;"><b>recurse</b></span> on blocks guarded by reentrant locks (sync methods, sync statement)

```java
// Method 1
public synchronized void foo(int x) {
   // some condition ...
   foo(x-1); // recurse does not cause error
}

// Method 2
public void foo(int x) {
   synchronized(this) { // note that 'this' is the lock. Otherwise, non-reentrant
	// some condition ...
       foo(x-1); // recurse does not cause error
   }
}

// Method 3
Object obj1 = new Object();
synchronized(obj1){
   System.out.println("Try out object ack 1");
   synchronized(obj1){ // intrinsic lock is reentrant
       System.out.println("Try out obj ack 2"); // will be printed
   }
}
```

## Reentrance Lockout

If you use a <span style="color:#f77729;"><b>non-reentrant lock</b></span> and recurse OR try to acquire the lock again, you will suffer from <span style="color:#f7007f;"><b>reentrance lockout</b></span>. We demonstrate it with the custom lock below:

```java
public class CustomLock{

 private boolean isLocked = false;

 public synchronized void lock() throws InterruptedException{
   while(isLocked){
     wait();
   }
   isLocked = true;
 }

 public synchronized void unlock(){
   isLocked = false;
   notify();
 }

}
```

And the usage:

```java
CustomLock lock = new CustomLock()

// Thread 1 code
public void doSomething(int argument){
   lock.lock();
   // recurse
   doSomething(argument-1);
   lock.unlock();
}
```

A thread that calls `lock()` for the first time will <span style="color:#f77729;"><b>succeed</b></span>, but the second call to lock() will be blocked since the variable `isLocked == true`.

## Releasing Locks

One final point to note is that some implementations require you to <span style="color:#f77729;"><b>release</b></span> the lock `N` times after <span style="color:#f77729;"><b>acquiring</b></span> it `N` times. You need to carefully <span style="color:#f77729;"><b>read the documentation</b></span> to see if the locks are auto released or if you need to explicitly release a lock `N` times to allow others to successfully acquire it again.

## Fine-Grained Condition Synchronisation

If we want to perform fine grained condition synchronization, we can use Java's <span style="color:#f77729;"><b>named</b></span> conditional variables and a reentrant lock. Named conditional variables are created explicitly by first creating a `ReentrantLock()`. The template is as follows:

```java
Lock lock = new ReentrantLock();
Condition lockCondition = lock.newCondition(); // call this multiple times if you have more than 1 condition

// Step 1: LOCK
lock.lock(); // remember, need to lock before calling await()

// Step 2a: WAIT
// To wait for specific condition:
lockCondition.await();

// OR Step 2b: SIGNAL
// To signal specific thread waiting for this condition:
lockCondition.signal();
// ...
// ...

// Step 3: UNLOCK
lock.unlock();
```

At first, we associate a conditional variable with a lock: `lock.newCondition()`. This <span style="color:#f77729;"><b>forces</b></span> us to always hold a lock when a condition is being signaled or waited for.

We can modify the example above of N threads which can only progress if `id == turn` to use <span style="color:#f77729;"><b>conditional variables</b></span> as follows:

```java
// Create arrays of condition
Lock lock = new ReentrantLock();
ArrayList<Condition> condVars = new ArrayList<Condition>();
for(int i = 0; i<N; i++) condVars.add(lock.newCondition()); // create N conditions, one for each Thread
```

The Thread function is changed to incorporate a wait to each `condVars[id]`:

```java
// the function
public void doWork(int id)
{
   lock.lock();
   while (turn != id)
   {
       try
       {
             condVars[id].await();
	}
       catch (InterruptedException e){}
   }
   // CS
   // assume there's some work to be done here...
   turn = (turn + 1) % N;
   condVars[turn].signal();
   lock.unlock();
}
```

# Summary

There are a few <span style="color:#f77729;"><b>solutions</b></span> to the CS problem. The CS problem can be divided into two types:

- <span style="color:#f7007f;"><b>Mutual exclusion </b></span>
- <span style="color:#f7007f;"><b>Condition synchronization</b></span>

There are also a few solutions listed below.

<span style="color:#f77729;"><b>Software mutex algorithms</b></span> provide mutex via busy-wait.

<span style="color:#f77729;"><b>Hardware</b></span> synchronisation methods provide mutex via <span style="color:#f77729;"><b>atomic</b></span> instructions.

> Other software spinlocks and mutex algorithms can be derived using these special atomic assembly instructions

<span style="color:#f77729;"><b>Semaphores</b></span> provide <span style="color:#f77729;"><b>mutex</b></span> using binary semaphores.

Basic <span style="color:#f77729;"><b>condition</b></span> variables provide <span style="color:#f7007f;"><b>condition synchronization</b></span> and are used along with a mutex lock.

<span style="color:#f77729;"><b>Java anonymous</b></span> default synchronization object provides mutex using reentrant binary lock (`this`), and provides condition synchronisation using `wait()` and `notifyAll()` or `notify()`

<span style="color:#f77729;"><b>Java named synchronization</b></span> object provides mutex using named reentrant binary lock (`ReentrantLock()`) and provides condition sync using condition variables and `await()/signal()`

It is entirely up to you to figure out which one to use for your application.
