If you have reached this stage, you have completed 95% of this assignment, <span style="color:#f7007f;"><b>congratulations</b></span>! One final step is some <span style="color:#f77729;"><b>administrative work</b></span> that will help your instructors grade your assignments seamlessly.

Please read this section very very carefully and watch the given demo with your full attention.
{:.error}

You are expected to <span style="color:#f77729;"><b>store</b></span> TWO additional files each time a client sends a file to the server:

1. Client to save encrypted files to `source/send_files_enc` before sending, with the name: `enc_[filename]`, e.g: `enc_image.ppm` if it is sending `image.ppm` to the server.
2. Server to save received encrypted file to client to `source/recv_files_enc` before decrypting, with the name `enc_recv_[filename]`, e.g: `enc_recv_image.ppm`.

You should have the following files now:
<img src="/50005-2023/assets/images/pa2/2.png"  class="center_fifty"/>

The new files are mainly (<span style="color:#f7007f;"><b>names must be exactly these!</b></span>):

1. `server_signed.crt`, and `server_private_key.pem` under `source/auth`
2. `ClientWithSecurityAP/CP1/CP2.py` and `ServerWithSecurityAP/CP1/CP2.py`.

All other files inside `source/files` directory must remain as per the original files.

You can now run the autograder yourself, assuming your current working directory is at the same level as `source/`. The second argument can be 1 or 2 depending on whether you want to test CP1 or CP2.

```
python3 autograde.py 1
python3 autograde.py 2
```

You should have the following message if everything goes well (`8` marks for CP1, and `14` marks for CP2).

<img src="/50005-2023/assets/images/pa2/3.png"  class="center_fifty"/>

You should then make the final commit of all tracked files so far:

```
git commit -a -m "feat: save to recv_files_enc and send_files_enc before encrypting and before sending"
```

You can also put your own large files at `source/files` (>100MB) to <span style="color:#f77729;"><b>test</b></span> internally, but <span style="color:#f77729;"><b>remove</b></span> it before pushing to Github since it doesn't allow you to push any single file >100MB. Please <span style="color:#f77729;"><b>do not use</b></span> `git-lfs`.

## Print Statements

The autograder does not check your program's `stdout`, so you're <span style="color:#f77729;"><b>free to print</b></span> whatever you need or want during the development of the assignment.

## Following Protocols Closely (1%)

As stated throughout the handout, you need to stick to the protocol <span style="color:#f77729;"><b>strictly</b></span>, that is to implement each `MODE` as specified (`send` or `read` exactly as specified in the `MODE`) so that we can run your server scripts against our <span style="color:#f77729;"><b>answer key</b></span> client scripts and vice versa. This is where the last 1% of your grade come from.

> You may easily ensure this by checking your server against another pair's client, and vice versa. You may need to handle two cases: ensure the padding schemes <span style="color:#f77729;"><b>match</b></span>, and check for `MODE 1` if the encrypted bytes are concatenated together by client before sending to server, or if client is sending it 128 bytes at a time (and server decrypt each chunk and assemble).

Not to worry, our server and client scripts that will be used to test your client and server script will handle these cases.

## Demo

The following video shows the expected interaction between Server and Client processes.

## Submission

Go to our bot and type `/start`. Follow the instructions there. You're only required to submit the github remote repo link.

<span style="color:#f7007f;"><b>We will clone your repo for grading. Make sure you check that it runs with the given autograder before submitting.</b></span> The bot <span style="color:#f77729;"><b>will scale and report your marks out of 8 points (8%, which is the total marks for PA2)</b></span>. We will manually check for plagiarism cases.

And it goes without saying that submitting any unrunnable code grants you <span style="color:#f7007f;"><b>0</b></span>. This <span style="color:#f7007f;"><b>includes</b></span> using other modules that's not already been stated in the starter code. Please <span style="color:#f7007f;"><b>do NOT</b></span> import anything else. Our VM will not have any other modules installed to run your script.
