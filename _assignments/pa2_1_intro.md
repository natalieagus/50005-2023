In this assignment, you will implement a <span style="color:#f77729;"><b>secure</b></span> file upload application from a <span style="color:#f77729;"><b>client</b></span> to a secure file <span style="color:#f77729;"><b>server</b></span>. By _secure_, we mean three <span style="color:#f77729;"><b>fulfilled</b></span> requirements:

1. First, before you do your upload as the client, you should <span style="color:#f7007f;"><b>authenticate</b></span> the identity of the file server so you won’t leak your data to random entities including criminals.
2. Secondly, you also want to ensure that you’re talking to a <span style="color:#f7007f;"><b>live</b></span> server too.
3. Thirdly, while carrying out the upload you should be able to protect the <span style="color:#f7007f;"><b>confidentiality</b></span> of the data against eavesdropping by any curious adversaries.

You may complete this assignment in <span style="color:#f7007f;"><b>pairs</b></span>. Indicate your partner's name in the google sheet provided in our course handout.
{:.info}

There are <span style="color:#f7007f;"><b>three</b></span> parts of this assignment:

1. Authentication Protocol (AP)
2. Confidentiality Protocol 1 (CP1)
3. Confidentiality Protocol 2 (CP2)

## System Requirements

The starter code provided to you is written in Python. You need at least <span style="color:#f7007f;"><b>Python 3.10</b></span> to complete this assignment and the [`cryptography`](https://pypi.org/project/cryptography/) module.

While you can develop in Python using any OS, you still need to ensure that your assignment runs on a <span style="color:#f7007f;"><b>POSIX-compliant OS</b></span> (path, etc is resolved).
{:.warning}

## Starter Code

You should have joined the GitHub Classroom and obtain the starter code for this assignment there. The link can be found in the Course Calendar portion of your Course Handout.

<!-- Download the starter code:
```
git clone https://github.com/natalieagus/pa2.git
```-->

### PA2 Files

This will result in a directory called `pa2`. Anything under `source/` is where you will work for this assignment. All files in the same level as `source/` are for <span style="color:#f77729;"><b>autograding purposes</b></span>. Do not modify these.

```
pa2/
  |-source/
    |-auth/
        |-cacsertificate.crt
        |-generate_keys.py
    |-files/
        |-cbc.bmp
        |-file.txt
        |-image.ppm
        |-jsim.jar
        |-player.psd
        |-squeak.wav
        |-vscodejsim.mp4
        |-week9.html
    |-recv_files/
    |-recv_files_enc/
    |-send_files_enc/
    |-ClientWithoutSecurity.py
    |-ServerWithoutSecurity.py
  |-autograde.py
  |-cleanup.sh
  |-input1
  |-input2
  |-output_client
  |-output_server
  |-result
  |-result_enc
  |-result_plain
```

`source/recv_files`, `source/recv_files_enc`, and `source/send_files_enc` are all empty directories that are not added in `.git`. To create them, simply run `./cleanup.sh` in `pa2` as your current working directory. You should see exactly the above file structure afterwards. `./cleanup.sh` is a bash script, in order to **execute** it you must `chmod` it to be executable first.  
{:.error}

<!-- ### Create a Github Remote Repo
Similar to Programming Assignment 1, create a <span style="color:#f7007f;"><b>private</b></span> remote repo on Github called `pa_2`.

If you're lazy (in a good way), simply <span style="color:#f77729;"><b>rename</b></span> your `pa_1` repo to `pa_2` on `github.com`. Then, open your local old `pa_1` repo and delete all the old files (but keep `.git` there). Paste all new files from `pa2`, including `.gitignore`. You can simply name the directory of your local `pa_1` repo to `pa_2` for consistency sake, it doesn't matter.

Finally `push` them as per normal. Since `natalieagus-sutd` is already a collaborator, you don't need to re-invite her.
{:.warning}

If you'd like to save your `pa_1` work, you can first create a branch called `pa1` before you do all the above:
```
git checkout -b pa1
```
Then push it to remote:
```
git push --set-upstream origin pa1
```
Afterwards, switch back to `master`:
```
git checkout master
```
...and replace the files with this assignment's starter code.

> Whatever you decide, just make sure `natalieagus-sutd` is a collaborator to your remote repo.

### Default branch: master
You need to make `master` your <span style="color:#f77729;"><b>default</b></span> branch as well. You're free to create other branches but `master` is the branch which we will <span style="color:#f77729;"><b>grade</b></span>.

You will be required to make a `commit`{:.error} after each Task in this PA2 as well. This is part of our <span style="color:#f7007f;"><b>grading</b></span> requirement. We want to see that you actually make good practices and perform periodic commits.

### Add `natalieagus-sutd` as collaborator
If you create a new private repo, invite `natalieagus-sutd` (not `natalieagus`!) as collaborator and give her 24-48 hours to respond.  -->

## Test the Starter Code

The starter code provided to you implements a <span style="color:#f77729;"><b>simple</b></span>, non-secure file transfer protocol. We will explain in detail what the protocol is. For now, let's just ensure that everything runs normally.

- Change the current working directory to `source/`.
  - This is where we assume your working directory is <span style="color:#f77729;"><b>unless otherwise stated.</b></span>
- Run `python3 ServerWithoutSecurity.py`, then run `python3 ClientWithoutSecurity.py` in two terminal windows
- You can key in the filename you want to send, e.g `files/image.ppm` from the Client's window, and the server will receive it and store it under `source/recv_files` directory.
  - Remember that the current working directory of the Client is `source/`
- You can repeat the above steps multiple times for each file you want to send to the server.
- If the client would like to close connection to the server, key in `-1`.

The screenshot below shows how client process can send files to the server process, when both are hosted in the same computer:

<img src="/50005-2023/assets/images/pa2/4.png"  class="center_seventy"/>

You can also host the Server file in another computer:

```
python3 ServerWithoutSecurity.py [port] [server-ip-address]
```

The client can connect to it using the command:

```
python3 ClientWithoutSecurity.py [port] [server-ip-address]
```

Notes:

- To get this to work, you most probably need to use <span style="color:#f77729;"><b>private</b></span> ip address instead of public one, unless you have set a static public IP
- You might need to enable <span style="color:#f77729;"><b>port forwarding</b></span> if you use a public IP, but if you aren't sure what you're doing then _dont_, you might expose yourself to a security vulnerability
- If this is all to complicated for you, _skip_. You can totally just do the assignment in the same computer

## Debug Notes

### Invalid Syntax

Some of you might encounter the error when running `python3 ServerWithoutSecurity.py`

```python
  match convert_bytes_to_int(read_bytes(client_socket, 8)):
        ^
      case 0:

SyntaxError: invalid syntax
```

That's because your `python3` <span style="color:#f7007f;"><b>is NOT aliased</b></span> to `python3.10` or that you don't have `python3.10` installed. <span style="color:#f7007f;"><b>Fix this on your own.</b></span> You're a CS major student. Not knowing how to install Python and manage its libraries is _a really really bad thing_; it's like as if the entire 50.002 and the first 6 weeks of CSE doesn't mean anything to you.

In this handout, we assume that `python3` is <span style="color:#f77729;"><b>always aliased</b></span> to `python3.10`.
{:.error}

That is, if you type `python3` in the terminal, you'll see at least version 3.10 printed out:
<img src="/50005-2023/assets/images/pa2/5.png"  class="center_seventy"/>

The <span style="color:#f7007f;"><b>autograder</b></span> file also uses `python3` instead of `python3.10`. You can modify it to call `python3.10` instead accordingly.

### Module Not Found

Some of you might encouter the error `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named ‘cryptography’`. You should know what you need to do by now as a CS student. If you have installed cryptography using `pip install cryptography`, but still suffer from this error, it simply means that the `pip` you used does not install to the path library of whatever `python3` version you are using right now. That is, you may have <span style="color:#f7007f;"><b>mixed</b></span> up `Python` and `pip` versions on your machine.

Assuming your `python3` is aliased to `python3.10`, then you can do:

```
python3 -m pip install cryptography
```

### Command Y Not Found

If you run `autograder.py` or `./cleanup.sh` and you're met with `command Y not found` error, then you can simply reisntall your whole OS.

_Just kidding_. Did you forget your Lab 1 materials? What does that error mean?

> That's right you just dont have the system program like `truncate` or `diff`. Simply install it for your own OS (`sudo apt install [program]` for Ubuntu, `brew install [program]` for macOS, etc).

### Autograder Complains File Output/Y Not Found

If the autograder complains that your programs did not produce the output files at the designated location under `source/output` but it did create these when ran manually, it's due to <span style="color:#f77729;"><b>trailing</b></span> whitespaces `\n\r` (invisible to the eye) that's present when it is reading `input1` or `input2`. For instance, your client program is trying to find `files/file.txt\r\n` instead of just `files/file.txt` because of the way the `input` files are loaded in your system.

Simply add a `strip()` function inside your `Client[version].py` scripts when getting `filename` from the <span style="color:#f77729;"><b>user</b></span> to eliminate these trailing whitespaces.

### No Such File or Directory: recv_files/EXPECTED_FILE

Depending on your OS, when you run `ServerWithSecurity[version].py` or the <span style="color:#f77729;"><b>autograder</b></span>, it might complain about files in the directories: `recv_files/EXPECTED_FILE`, `recv_files_enc/EXPECTED_FILE`, etc <span style="color:#f77729;"><b>not found</b></span> when you clearly have it in your project path or have run `cleanup.sh`.

This is due to differences in what constitutes a _line break_:

- `\r\n` is a Windows Style
- `\n` is a POSIX Style
- `\r` is a old pre-OS X Macs Style, Modern Mac's using POSIX Style

Therefore your directory name might be set as `recv_files\r\n` when you run `cleanup.sh`. You can't tell whether the line break is there or not. Similarly, when you receive `filename` from `input` in `ClientWithSecurity[version].py`, the line break might be there, creating filename like `files.txt\r\n`. In order to tackle this, you can:

1. Add `.strip()` at the end of `input`, resulting in `input("Enter a filename....").strip()`
2. Create a new `cleanup.sh` with the exact same content and overwrites the old one so that the line break suits your system's

When submitting, please use `LF` as your end of line sequence because we are running your code on Linux-distro containers.
{:.warning}

### Command truncate Not Found

It is possible that you might not have `truncate` system program installed by default. You have learned the File System in Week 6, so we suppose you know why we use it in our autograder.

To install, simply type `sudo apt -y install coreutils` (Ubuntu), or `brew install coreutils` (macOS).

## Do NOT Import Other Python Modules

You are <span style="color:#f7007f;"><b>NOT</b></span> allowed to import any other python modules other than what's given:

```python
import pathlib
import socket
import sys
import time
from datetime import datetime
import secrets
import traceback

from cryptography import x509
from cryptography.exceptions import InvalidSignature
from cryptography.fernet import Fernet
from cryptography.hazmat.primitives import hashes, serialization
from cryptography.hazmat.primitives.asymmetric import padding
from cryptography.hazmat.backends import default_backend
```

### Bot: Autograder Fails to Run

If the bot complains that the autograder **fails to run**, then check if you have modified the `./cleanup.sh` to be **executable**. We did not explicitly tell you to `chmod +x ./cleanup.sh` , but we _did_ ask you to run it. You did go through Lab 1 right? Yes? We assume you know how to _apply knowledge_.

### Local Autograder Works, but not Bot's

Check that your local autograder did printout **exactly** the following:

<img src="/50005-2023/assets/images/pa2/3.png"  class="center_fifty"/>

That means: **no error messages** like "file A not found". We only give `autograde.py` to you so that you can have some kind of checker beforehand, but we can't guarantee 100% that it will not give false positives because you might not be using the same exact Python >3.10 version, have different system programs or different Linux distros altogether. If you're not sure what went wrong, **just OPEN** `autograde.py` and figure it out. It's in Python! How hard can it be?

> We would've given you a Docker image but then if you can't debug your own code given the autograder written in Python, then apologies, we don't have enough faith yet that you can install Docker on your own and spawn a container properly. Maybe someday 🥹.
