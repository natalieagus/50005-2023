Now that we understand how TinyOS works, we can implement two things for this lab: a mouse interrupt handler and a mouse supervisor call.

## Part A: Add mouse interrupt handler

When you **click** the mouse over the **console pane**, BSim generates an **interrupt**, forcing the PC to `0x80000010` (remember the interrupt vector?) and saving `PC+4` of the interrupted instruction in the `XP` register. We paste the interrupt vector here again for your reference. Interrupt vector is **hardwired** in the CPU:

```nasm
. = VEC_RESET   | This is loaded at address 0x80000000
	BR(I_Reset)	| on Reset (start-up)
. = VEC_II      | This is loaded at address 0x80000004
	BR(I_IllOp)	| on Illegal Instruction (eg SVC)
. = VEC_CLK     | This is loaded at address 0x80000008
	BR(I_Clk)	| On clock interrupt
. = VEC_KBD     | This is loaded at address 0x8000000C
	BR(I_Kbd)	| on Keyboard interrupt
. = VEC_MOUSE   | This is loaded at address 0x80000010
	BR(I_BadInt)	| on mouse interrupt
```

The Beta itself implements a **vectored interrupt** scheme where different types of interrupts force the PC to different addresses (rather than having all interrupts for the PC to `0x80000008` and query each I/O device for input fetch). The following table shows how different interrupt events are mapped to `PC` values (PCSEL is wired to set `PC` to be these values depending on the triggering interrupt):

```nasm
0x80000000	reset
0x80000004	illegal opcode
0x80000008	clock interrupt (must specify “.options clk” to enable)
0x8000000C	keyboard interrupt (must specify “.options tty” to enable)
0x80000010	mouse interrupt (must specify “.options tty” to enable)
```

The original `tinyOS.uasm` prints out “Illegal interrupt” and then **halts** if a mouse interrupt is received:

**Change** this behavior by:

1. Adding an interrupt handler that **stores** the click information in a new kernel memory location and then,
2. **Returns** to the **interrupted process**.

You might find the keyboard interrupt handler `I_Kbd` a good model to follow. Also, you might find this [bsim documentation](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Tq_Hg-jbZVPKDJZ4O6OZWYF4_8ywakbi/view?usp=share_link) and [beta isa documentation](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1v-eaGuxa1W5HPPNi_shvdS1g5z99if3_/view?usp=share_link) handy.

### The CLICK() instruction

For this Lab, there exist a Beta instruction your interrupt handler can use to retrieve information (coordinates of click) about the last mouse click: `CLICK()`.

This instruction **can only be executed when in kernel mode** (e.g., from **inside** the mouse click interrupt handler).

It returns a value in `R0: -1` if there has not been a mouse click since the last time `CLICK()` was executed, or a **32-bit integer**.

The integer is formatted as follows:

- The `X` coordinate of the click in the **high-order** 16 bits of the word, and
- The `Y` coordinate of the click in the **low-order** 16 bits.

The coordinates are **non-negative** and relative to the **upper left hand corner** of the console pane. In our scenario, `CLICK()` should only be called **AFTER** a mouse click interrupt occur, so we should never see `-1` as a return value.

### Testing Your Implementation with `.breakpoint`

Insert a `.breakpoint` instruction right before the `JMP(XP)` at the end of your mouse interrupt handler, run the program and click the mouse over the console pane.

If things are working correctly the simulation should **stop** at the breakpoint and you can **examine** the kernel memory location where the mouse info was stored to verify that it is correct. In the sample below, we name the memory location as `Mouse_State`, and the value in the red box signifies the coordinates of the mouse click made in the console pane.

### Task 1

`CHECKOFF`{:.info}

Continuing execution (click the “Run” button in the toolbar at the top of the window) should return to the interrupted program. Demonstrate the above result to your instructor / TA in class. **When you’re done remember to remove the breakpoint.**
