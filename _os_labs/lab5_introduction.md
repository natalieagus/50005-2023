You need Python 3.10.x or above to complete this lab.
{:.info}

In <span style="color:#f7007f;"><b>deadlock avoidance</b></span>, before granting a resource request (even if the request is valid and the requested resources are now available), we need to <span style="color:#f77729;"><b>check</b></span> that the request will not cause the system to enter a deadlock state in the future or immediately.

The Banker's Algorithm is a resource allocation and deadlock avoidance algorithm. It can be used to predict and compute whether or not the current request will lead to a <span style="color:#f77729;"><b>deadlock</b></span>.

- If yes, the request for the resources will be <span style="color:#f77729;"><b>rejected</b></span>,
- Otherwise, it will be <span style="color:#f77729;"><b>granted</b></span>.

There are two parts of the Banker's Algorithm:

1. <span style="color:#f77729;"><b>Resource Allocation</b></span> Algorithm
2. <span style="color:#f77729;"><b>Safety</b></span> Algorithm

You will be implementing the <span style="color:#f77729;"><b>Safety Algorithm</b></span> and calling it in Resource Allocation Algorithm in this lab.

# Banker's Algorithm

## Prerequisite

Suppose we have `N` processes competing for `M` different types of resources. We call these processes "<span style="color:#f7007f;"><b>customers</b></span>" (to these available resources).

In order for the Banker's Algorithm to work, need to know the <span style="color:#f7007f;"><b>maximum</b></span> demand of process `i` for resource `j` instances.
{:.warning}

## System State

We also need to represent the <span style="color:#f7007f;"><b>system STATE</b></span>, such as the amount of resources available per-type-per-process using the following data structures:

1. available: 1 by M vector

- `available[i]`: the available instances of resource `i`

2. max: N by M matrix

- `max[i][j]`: maximum demand of process `i` for resource `j` instances

3. allocation: N by M matrix

- `allocation[i][j]`: current allocation of resource `j` instances for process `i`

4. need: N by M matrix

- `need[i][j]`: how much more of resource `j` instances might be needed by process `i`

For example, the following arrays display the `available`, `max`, `allocation`, and `need` values of a current state of a system with 5 processes: `P0`, `P1`, `P2`, `P3`, and `P4`, and 3 types of resources: `A`, `B`, `C`;

<img src="/50005/assets/images/lab3/1.png"  class="center_seventy"/>

## Banker.py

Open `Banker.py` and give it a quick read.

There are a few methods defined in `Class Banker`:

1. `set_maximum_demand`: implemented for you, this populates the corresponding row of `max` matrix
2. `request_resources`: request resource algorithm implementation. <span style="color:#f77729;"><b>Task 1 is here</b></span>.
3. `release_resources`: releases resources borrowed by a customer. Assume release is valid for <span style="color:#f77729;"><b>simplicity</b></span>
4. `check_safe`: safety check algorithm implementation. <span style="color:#f77729;"><b>Task 2 is here</b></span>.
5. `print_state` and `run_file`: functions to load the input files and printing the states of the system: `available, max, allocation, need` values.

## Input Format

The inputs to `banker.py` are inside `test_files/`. All `.txt` files named as `qi.txt` are various input files.

The format are as follows:

1. The first three lines contain values of `N` (number of processes), `M` (number of resource type), and the contents of the `available` vector.
2. For lines starting with `c`, it signifies the `max` demand of a process for ALL resource types.
   - The format is `c,pid,rid_1 rid_2 rid_3 ...`
3. For lines starting with `r`, it signifies a request by a process.
   - The format is: `r,pid,rid_1 rid_2 rid_3 ...`
4. For lines starting with `f`, it signifies a release of resources by a process.
   - The format is: `f,pid,rid_1 rid_2 rid_3 ...`
5. For lines with just `p`, we print the state of the system

The lines in the input are read from top to bottom, and are treated as incoming requests or releases by each process <span style="color:#f77729;"><b>as time progresses</b></span>.

For instance, open `test_files/q0.txt`:

```
n,3
m,3
a,0 0 0
c,0,2 2 4
c,1,2 1 3
c,2,3 4 1
r,0,1 2 1
r,1,2 0 1
r,2,2 2 1
p
```

From the first two lines, we know that there are 3 distinct processes (`N`) competing for 3 different types of resources (`M`).

- Let's name them as P0, P1, and P2 so that it is easier for us to address them.
- Also label each of the 3 resources as A, B, and C.

From the third line, we know that NONE of the resources are available: `available = [0,0,0]`.

In the fourth to sixth line, we can initialise the `max` matrix as follows:

```
max = [ [2,2,4]
        [2,1,3]
        [3,4,1] ]
```

This means `P0` will need <span style="color:#f77729;"><b>at most</b></span> 2 instances of Resource A, 2 instances of Resource B, and 4 instances of Resource C during its lifetime of execution. Similar logic for P1 and P2.

In the seventh line `r,0,1 2 1`, P0 starts requesting for 1 instance of Resource A, 2 instances of Resource B, and 1 instance of Resource C simultanously.

<span style="color:#f77729;"><b>We will need to run the Banker's algorithm now to determine whether this request is `safe`, and to be granted</b></span>.
{:.warning}

This is already done for you inside `run_file` function. Whenever line with `r` is encountered, the function `request_resources` is called.

- If the request is granted, we need to update `available`, `allocation` and `need`. This is already done for you inside `request_resources` function.
- If the request is not granted, we simply ignore that request. The values of `available`, `allocation` and `need` remains the same. This is already done for you inside `request_resources` function.

The same is done for all lines starting with `r`.

At the end, we print the state of the system with `p`.

In this example, NO resources are available. So obviously we are met with the same state of `available`, `allocation` and `need` after running the file.

You can run the file using the command:

```
python3.10 banker.py test_files/q0.txt
```

The output is as such as expected, with `allocation` matrix remaining at 0.

```
Customer 0 requesting
[1, 2, 1]
Customer 1 requesting
[2, 0, 1]
Customer 2 requesting
[2, 2, 1]

Current state:
Available:
[0, 0, 0]

Maximum:
[2, 2, 4]
[2, 1, 3]
[3, 4, 1]

Allocation:
[0, 0, 0]
[0, 0, 0]
[0, 0, 0]

Need:
[2, 2, 4]
[2, 1, 3]
[3, 4, 1]
```

Experiment with the other 5 files as well. Try them one by one and study the result.

```
python3.10 banker.py test_files/q1.txt
python3.10 banker.py test_files/q2.txt
python3.10 banker.py test_files/q3.txt
python3.10 banker.py test_files/q4.txt
python3.10 banker.py test_files/q5.txt
```

## Resource Request Algorithm

This algorithm is already implemented for you inside `request_resources` function. This algorithm is called each time we encounter a resource request (line starting with `r`). The function receives two parameters and returns a bool:

```py
def request_resources(self, customer_index, request):
    """
    Request resources for a customer loan.

    Parameters
    ----------
    customer_index : int
        the customer's index (0-indexed)
    request : list[int]
        an array of the requested count for each resource

    Returns
    -------
    True : if the requested resources can be loaned
    False : otherwise
    """
```

The algorithm goes as follows:

1. If `request[i] <= need[customer_index][i]` for all `i < M`, go to step 2. Otherwise, return `False` <span style="color:#f7007f;"><b>(request rejected)</b></span> since the process has exceeded its maximum claim.

2. If `request[i] <= available[i]` for all `i < M`, go to step 3. Otherwise, return `False`.

   - Process i must <span style="color:#f77729;"><b>wait</b></span> since its requested resources are not immediately available <span style="color:#f7007f;"><b>(request rejected)</b></span>.

3. At this point, the requested resources are available, but we <span style="color:#f77729;"><b>check</b></span> if granting the request is <span style="color:#f7007f;"><b>safe</b></span> (will not lead to deadlock).

   - Create a `deepcopy` of `available`, `allocation`, and `need`
   - Pass these new data structures to the `safety_check` algorithm, which will return `True` (safe) or `False` (unsafe)

4. If the outcome of Step(3) is:
   - `True`: <span style="color:#f77729;"><b>UPDATE</b></span> all system states concerning Process i <span style="color:#f7007f;"><b>(request granted)</b></span>:
     - `available[i] = available[i] - request[i]` for all `i<M`
     - `need[customer_index][i] = need[customer_index][i] - request[i]` for all `i<M`
     - `allocation[customer_index][i] = allocation[customer_index][i] + request[i]` for all `i<M`
   - `False`: This means <span style="color:#f7007f;"><b>request rejected</b></span>, and process i has to try again in the future. This is because granting the request results in deadlock in the future.

### Example 1

You may run: `python3.10 banker.py test_files/q1.txt` and study the output.

Initially, we know that `allocation` was initialised as 0 and that `available=[5,5,5]` from the third line in `test_files/q1.txt`. The first 3 requests are <span style="color:#f77729;"><b>granted</b></span>:

```
Customer 0 requesting
[1, 2, 1]
Customer 1 requesting
[2, 0, 1]
Customer 2 requesting
[2, 2, 1]
```

After granting the three requests above, we have the system state:

```
Current state:
Available:
[0, 1, 2]

Maximum:
[2, 2, 4]
[2, 1, 3]
[3, 4, 1]

Allocation:
[1, 2, 1]
[2, 0, 1]
[2, 2, 1]

Need:
[1, 0, 3]
[0, 1, 2]
[1, 2, 0]
```

Further request by Process 0: `request=[0,1,0]` is rejected because Process 0 requests <span style="color:#f77729;"><b>MORE</b></span> than what's been declared at `maximum`.

- It declared that it needs at maximum of 2 resources B (the second type of resource)
- It already held 2 types of resources B --> `need[0][1]: 2`

```
Customer 0 requesting
[0, 1, 0]

Current state: <--- request above is rejected, hence state remains the same.
Available:
[0, 1, 2]

Maximum:
[2, 2, 4]
[2, 1, 3]
[3, 4, 1]

Allocation:
[1, 2, 1]
[2, 0, 1]
[2, 2, 1]

Need:
[1, 0, 3]
[0, 1, 2]
[1, 2, 0]
```

### Example 2

You may run: `python3.10 banker.py test_files/q2.txt` and study the output.

This time round, we have `N=5` processes and `M=3` different types of resources, and `available=[10,5,7]`.

After such requests from all customers,

```
Customer 0 requesting
[0, 1, 0]
Customer 1 requesting
[2, 0, 0]
Customer 2 requesting
[3, 0, 2]
Customer 3 requesting
[2, 1, 1]
Customer 4 requesting
[0, 0, 2]
```

...we should have only 3 counts of Resource A available (the first type of resource).

However here we witness Process 0 releasing 1 instance of Resource A, and hence the updated system state:

```
Customer 1 releasing
[1, 0, 0]

Current state:
Available:
[4, 3, 2]

Maximum:
[7, 5, 3]
[3, 2, 2]
[9, 0, 2]
[2, 2, 2]
[4, 3, 3]

Allocation:
[0, 1, 0]
[1, 0, 0]
[3, 0, 2]
[2, 1, 1]
[0, 0, 2]

Need:
[7, 4, 3]
[2, 2, 2]
[6, 0, 0]
[0, 1, 1]
[4, 3, 1]
```

### Task 1

`TASK 1:`{:.info} Call `check_safe` algorithm inside `request_resources` in `banker.py`.
Right now the variable `safe` is always set to `True`, hence we <span style="color:#f77729;"><b>always grant</b></span> the request as long as the resources are available and the processes do not violate their `max`. For input `q0, q1, q2`, we are <span style="color:#f77729;"><b>lucky</b></span> because we never had any requests that might result in deadlock.

However, if you try running the program with `q3`:

```
python3.10 banker.py test_files/q3.txt
```

...you will notice that the printed output is not the same as the answer: `test_files/q3_answer.txt`. We need to <span style="color:#f77729;"><b>implement and call</b></span> the `check_safe` algorithm to ensure that we get the right answer.

Let's start easy. Since `check_safe` function is already defined (although not yet implemented), <span style="color:#f77729;"><b>call</b></span> `check_safe` method and assign their return value to `safe`:

```py
  # Task 1
  # TODO: Check if the state is safe or not by calling check_safe, right now it is hardcoded to True
  # 1. Perform a deepcopy of available, need, and allocation
  # 2. Call the check_safe method with new data in (1)
  # 3. Store the return value of (2) in variable safe
  # DO NOT PRINT ANYTHING ELSE

  ### BEGIN ANSWER HERE ###
  safe = True  # Change this line

  ### END OF TASK 1 ###

  if safe:
      # If it is safe, allocate the resources to customer customer_number
      for idx, req_val in enumerate(request):
          self.allocation[customer_index][idx] += req_val
          self.need[customer_index][idx] -= req_val
          self.available[idx] -= req_val

      bank_lock.release()
      return True
  else:
      bank_lock.release()
      return False
```

**DO NOT PRINT ANYTHING ELSE**. Please remove your debug messages.
{:.error}

## The Safety Algorithm

This algorithm is <span style="color:#f77729;"><b>also</b></span> called each time we encounter a resource request (line starting with `r`), but only if we managed to enter <span style="color:#f77729;"><b>Step 3</b></span> of the Resource Request Algorithm. The function receives five parameters and returns a `bool`:

```py
def check_safe(self, customer_index, request, work, need, allocation):
    """
    Checks if the request will leave the bank in a safe state.

    Parameters
    ----------
    work, need, allocation : list[int], list[list[int]], list[list[int]]
        deep copy of available, need, and allocation matrices
    customer_index : int
        the customer's index (0-indexed)
    request : list[int]
        an array of the requested count for each resource

    Returns
    -------
    True : if the request resources will leave the bank in a safe state
    False : otherwise
    """
```

The algorithm goes as follows:

1. Create a vector `finish: list[int]` of size `N`, initialised to be `False` for all elements in `finish`.

   - Then, <span style="color:#f77729;"><b>hypothetically</b></span> grant the current request by customer `customer_index` by updating:
     - `work[i] = work[i] - request[i]` for all `i<M`
     - `need[customer_index][i] = need[customer_index][i] - request[i]` for all `i<M`
     - `allocation[customer_index][i] = allocation[customer_index][] + request[i]` for all `i<M`
   - This request granting is _hypothetical_ because `work` is a <span style="color:#f77729;"><b>copy</b></span> of `available` (not the actual `available`). Similar argument with `need, allocation`. In reality, we haven't granted the request yet, we simply compute this hypothetical situation and decide whether it will be `safe` or `unsafe`.

2. Find an index `i` (which is a _customer_) such that:

   - `finish[i] == False` <span style="color:#f7007f;"><b>and</b></span>
   - `need[i][j] <= work[j]` for <span style="color:#f7007f;"><b>all</b></span> `j<M`.
   - The two above condition signifies that an incomplete Customer `i` can _complete_ even after this request by `customer_index` is granted

3. If such index `i` from Step 2 exists do the following, else go to Step 4.

   - Update: `work[j] = work[j] + allocation[i][j]` for <span style="color:#f7007f;"><b>all</b></span> `j<M`.
     - This signifies that a Customer `i` that can _complete_ will free its _currently_ allocated resources.
   - Update: `finish[i] = True`
   - <span style="color:#f7007f;"><b>Then, REPEAT step 2</b></span>
     > You might want to store the values of `i` each time you execute this Step 3 elsewhere to backtrack a possible safe execution sequence, but that's not required for this lab.

4. If no such index `i` in Step 2 exists:
   - If `finish[i] == True` for <span style="color:#f7007f;"><b>all</b></span> `i<N`, then it means the system is in a <span style="color:#f77729;"><b>safe state</b></span>. Return `True`.
   - Else, the system is <span style="color:#f77729;"><b>not in a safe state</b></span>. Return `False`.

## Careless Mistake

<span style="color:#f77729;"><b>Common careless mistake:</b></span> A lot of people missed the “REPEAT step 2” instruction in step 3. Step 2 and 3 must be implemented in a `while` loop, as you <span style="color:#f7007f;"><b>might NOT</b></span> necessarily obtain i in <span style="color:#f77729;"><b>sequential</b></span> (increasing) order.
{:.error}

> Why is that so? Does it mean we can have a <span style="color:#f7007f;"><b>safe</b></span> execution sequence e.g: `1,0,2` for a 3-process system? Yes of course! That simply means `P1` can be executed first, then `P0`, then `P2`. Think about what `i` represents (just arbitrary naming of consumer processes), of course a safe execution sequence has nothing to do with their naming!

### Example

Run the Banker algorithm with `q3`:

```
python3.10 banker.py test_files/q3.txt
```

At first, P0 is making the request `[1,0,3]` and it is <span style="color:#f77729;"><b>granted</b></span> as shown in the `allocation` matrix:

```
Customer 0 requesting
[1, 0, 3]

Current state:
Available:
[4, 2, 1]

Maximum:
[2, 2, 4]
[2, 1, 3]
[3, 1, 1]

Allocation:
[1, 0, 3]
[0, 0, 0]
[0, 0, 0]

Need:
[1, 2, 1]
[2, 1, 3]
[3, 1, 1]
```

> You can <span style="color:#f77729;"><b>verify</b></span> whether any requests so far is granted by checking that the `allocation` matrix value adds up to the requests made.

Then, P1 requests for `[1,1,1]`. This is a legal request, since if the request is granted, then P1 allocation (`allocation[1]` is initially `[0,0,0]`) will still be <span style="color:#f77729;"><b>not more than</b></span> its maximum: `max[1]: [2,1,3]`.

If your implementation is <span style="color:#f77729;"><b>correct</b></span>, this should however lead to an <span style="color:#f77729;"><b>unsafe state</b></span>, and hence the request is rejected and the state of the system remain the same:

```
Customer 1 requesting
[1, 1, 1]

Current state:
Available:
[4, 2, 1]

Maximum:
[2, 2, 4]
[2, 1, 3]
[3, 1, 1]

Allocation:
[1, 0, 3]
[0, 0, 0]
[0, 0, 0]

Need:
[1, 2, 1]
[2, 1, 3]
[3, 1, 1]
```

The same logic applies to samples in `q4` and `q5` as well:

- In q4, the last request by P0: `[0,2,0]` leads to an unsafe state and therefore <span style="color:#f77729;"><b>rejected</b></span>.
- In q4, the request by P1: `[1,0,2]` is rejected because it leads to an <span style="color:#f77729;"><b>unsafe state</b></span>. However, after P0 release the resources it held: `[1,3,4]`, a <span style="color:#f7007f;"><b>repeated</b></span> request by P1 for the same set of resources `[1,0,2]` is granted.

### Task 2

## Further Notes

### Rejecting Requests

If a resource request is <span style="color:#f77729;"><b>rejected</b></span>, dont panic, it's not the end of the world. The process/consumer just need to <span style="color:#f77729;"><b>try</b></span> to request it again in the future.

How can this be implemented? Usually schedulers are programmed to tackle this kind of cases; e.g: they can be placed to a special queue and will periodically prompt for resource request until granted, or there exists some kind of event-driven solution -- it's free-for-all to implement.

### Resource Release Caveat

We also assume that (for simplicity of this lab) a process will <span style="color:#f77729;"><b>not</b></span> release more than what has been allocated to them (that the value of `release` is valid). We wrote this detail under `release_resources` function:

```py
def release_resources(self, customer_index, release):
    """
    Releases resources borrowed by a customer. Assume release is valid for simplicity.

    Parameters
    ----------
    customer_index : int
        the customer's index (0-indexed)
    release : list[int]
        an array of the release count for each resource

    Returns
    -------
    None
    """
    print(f"Customer {customer_index} releasing\n{release}")

    bank_lock.acquire()
    # Release the resources from customer customer_number
    for idx, val in enumerate(release):
        self.allocation[customer_index][idx] -= val
        self.need[customer_index][idx] += val
        self.available[idx] += val
    bank_lock.release()
```

### Synchronisation

Finally, since `max, allocation, need` and `available` are shared data structures among all these methods, we protect each method that modifies these values using a <span style="color:#f77729;"><b>reentrant lock</b></span>: `bank_lock = threading.RLock()`.

We guard the <span style="color:#f77729;"><b>critical sections</b></span> with `bank_lock.acquire()` and `bank_lock.release()` to make it <span style="color:#f77729;"><b>thread safe</b></span>.
