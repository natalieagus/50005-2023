This is the second part of your lab, which is to implement a trap handler for the user process to access last mouse click.

## Part B: Add Mouse() Supervisor Call

Now our job is to **retrieve** the mouse click coordinates that is stored in the Kernel variable `Mouse_State` in the sample screenshot above. Implement a `Mouse()` supervisor call that returns the coordinate information from the most recent mouse click (i.e., the information stored by the mouse interrupt handler).

Like `GetKey()` supervisor call to retrieve keyboard press, a user-mode call to `Mouse()` should **consume** the available click information. If no mouse click has occurred since the previous call to Mouse(), the supervisor call should **‚Äúhang‚Äù** (blocks execution) until new click information is available.

### Blocking Execution

A blocking supervisor call means that the supervisor call should back up the calling process' context and move on to schedule other processes if there's no mouse click (**branch** to the **scheduler** to run some other user-mode program). It also adjust the calling process' PC so that the next user-mode instruction to be re-executed is the `Mouse()` call.

Thus when the calling program is **rescheduled** for execution at some later point, the `Mouse()` call is **re-executed** and the whole process repeated again (checking whether there's any recent mouse click). The calling process can only resume when there's a mouse click.

From the user‚Äôs point of view, the `Mouse()` call **completes** its execution only when there is **new** click information to be returned.

The `GetKey()` supervisor call is a good model to follow.

### Defining SVC Macro

To define a new supervisor call `Mouse()`, add the following definition just after the definition for `.macro Yield()	SVC(7)`:

```nasm
.macro Mouse()   SVC(8)
```

This is the **ninth** supervisor call and the current code at `SVC_UUO` was tailored for processing exactly **eight** supervisor calls, so you‚Äôll need to make the appropriate modifications to `SVC_UUO` instructions:

```nasm
||| Sub-handler for SVCs, called from I_IllOp on SVC opcode:

SVC_UUO:
	LD(XP, -4, r0)		| The faulting instruction.
	ANDC(r0,0x7,r0)		| Pick out low bits, should you modify this to support more supervisor calls?
	SHLC(r0,2,r0)		| make a word index,
	LD(r0,SVCTbl,r0)	| and fetch the table entry.
	JMP(r0)
```

You also need to modify the `SVCTbl` to now account for 9 supervisor calls instead of 8.

### Testing Your Implementation

Once your `Mouse()` implementation is complete, add a `Mouse()` instruction **just after P2Start**. If things are working correctly, this user-mode process should now **hang** and `Count3` should **not** be incremented even if you type in several sentences (i.e., the prompt should always be `00000000>`).

Now click the mouse once over the console pane and then type more sentences. The prompt should read `00000001>`

### Task 2

`CHECKOFF`{:.info}

Demonstrate the above result to your instructor / TA in class. When you are done, remember to **remove** the `Mouse()` instruction you added.
{: .info}

> Note that if you implement empty mouse buffer as `LONG(0)`, a click at valid coordinate `0,0` in the top left hand corner of the console will not be registered a valid mouse click, so you can't just wholesale copy the the `GetKey()` supervisor model. Please consider this in your implementation, a suggested way is to use `LONG(-1)` to indicate an empty mouse buffer.

## Summary

<span style="color:indianred; font-weight: bold;">Congratulations üçæ</span>, you have sucessfully implemented both asycnhronous and synchronous interrupt handlers for Mouse-related event.

Once you've get your checkoff, please save your work. We will continue using `TinyOS.uasm` in Lab 4.
