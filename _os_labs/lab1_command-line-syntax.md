The CLI accepts **commands** (the **first** word, e.g. ps, that you type into the CLI is the command), **entered line by line** and it will be executed **sequentially**. There are two types of commands in general, commands **with** and **without** options or arguments.

# Basic Commands

## Without Options

### Task 2

`TASK 2:`{:.info} Try the following basic commands in sequence `date`, `cal`, `pwd`, `who`, `clear`:

1. E.g: date and press enter. You should see today’s date given to you, for example:

```java
bash-3.2$ date
Thu May  5 14:08:51 +08 2022
bash-3.2$
```

2. Do the same thing with `cal, pwd, who, clear`.
   - Figure out what each command does using `man`
   - You can use `man <command>` and press `q` to quit anytime.

## With Options

The commands you have typed above are those that **do not** require options or more arguments (although they do accept these too). Some commands require more input arguments.

For example, the command ps shows the list of processes for the current shell, while `ps -x` shows all processes that are owned by the current user even when it doesn’t have a **controlling terminal**.

```java
bash-3.2$ ps
  PID TTY           TIME CMD
61581 ttys000    0:01.80 /bin/zsh -l
61605 ttys000    0:00.00 /bin/zsh -l
61652 ttys000    0:00.00 /bin/zsh -l
61653 ttys000    0:00.04 /bin/zsh -l

bash-3.2$ ps -x
  PID TTY           TIME CMD
  393 ??         0:02.43 /System/Library/Frameworks/LocalAuthentication.framework/Support/coreauthd
  394 ??         1:29.34 /usr/sbin/cfprefsd agent
  398 ??         0:00.05 /System/Library/Frameworks/ColorSync.framework/Versions/A/XPCServices/com.app
  399 ??        25:02.92 /usr/libexec/UserEventAgent (Aqua)
  401 ??         2:06.64 /usr/sbin/distnoted agent
  403 ??         0:12.27 /System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/CloudServices.framework/Helpers/com.apple.s
  404 ??         2:02.15 /usr/libexec/knowledge-agent
  405 ??         0:06.55 /usr/libexec/lsd
  406 ??         3:05.55 /usr/libexec/trustd --agent
  407 ??        15:44.58 /usr/libexec/secd
  409 ??         0:02.05 /System/Library/CoreServices/sharedfilelistd
  410 ??        40:41.61 /System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/CloudKitDaemon.framework/Support/cloudd
  411 ??         0:00.19 /System/Library/CoreServices/backgroundtaskmanagementagent
  412 ??         0:05.30 /System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/TCC.framework/Resources/tccd
  413 ??        12:36.92 /usr/libexec/nsurlsessiond
```

Some commands accept single hyphen (-) as options, and some other accepts double hyphens (--), or no hyphen at all. It really depends on **convention**, so be sure to **read the manual properly**.
{:.info}

For example, the command: `git commit -v -a --amend` stands for:

- Use git to **stage** new changes (`commit`)
- Automatically stage **all** files that have been modified/deleted (`-a`)
- Do it in a **verbose** way, with detailed message highlighting all diff (`-v`)
- **Replace** the tip of the current branch by creating a new commit (`--amend`)

# Path

## Basics of Directory

The file system has many directories, starting from the **ROOT** (symbolised as a single forward slash /) and you can have directories within a directory thus forming a **hierarchy** of directories. Each “level” is separated by the forward slash symbol.
{:.info}

For instance,

`/Users/natalie_agus/Downloads` simply look like this in the window:

<img src="/50005-2023/assets/images/lab1/2.png"  class="center_full"/>

If your directory has spaces in its name, you need to use the **backslash**) to indicate that it is part of the string, eg:
`/Users/natalie_agus/Google\ Drive`

### Task 3

`TASK 3:`{:.info} Find your starting context by running the command `pwd`, followed by `ls`:

- The command `ls` lists **all** files that exist in this **context**, which is the Desktop directory in the example above (`/Users/natalie_agus/Desktop`)
- When you run the command **ls** by itself, it uses your **current** directory as the context, and lists the files that are in the directory you are in.
- You can use the `ls` command to list the files in a directory that's **not** your current directory, e.g: `ls /Users/natalie_agus/Downloads`

Now try another command called `cd` to **change** the current working directory:

- Change the current working directory into any directory that’s accessible from the current context
- The command cd is analogous to **double clicking** a folder in the GUI
- You can go “back” to one previous directory level using the command `cd ..` (or you can chain it to go two levels up for instance, `cd ../..`

<img src="/50005-2023/assets/images/lab1/3.png"  class="center_full"/>

## Environment Variables

Another way of providing context is through something called **environment** **variables**. Tryout the command: `cd $HOME`

- The `$HOME` part is a reference to the HOME variable, and is replaced by the path to your home directory when the command is run.
- In other words, running cd `$HOME` is the same as running `cd <actual path to your home>`, or `cd ~` (~ is a default **shell variable** that points to the current User’s home directory, and it also has [other usages](https://www.baeldung.com/linux/tilde-bash) that you can read if you’re free).
- To checkout what the value of your `$HOME` variable is, type the command: echo `$HOME`

To find out about your current environment variables, you can enter the command `env`. Look at the values of common variables such as `HOME` and `PATH`. You can also create your own environment variables using the command `export`.
{:.info}

For example:

1. Run the command: `export MESSAGE1="This is message 1"`
2. You can now execute `echo $MESSAGE1` and observe get the string output

In the example below, the environment variable `$MESSAGE1` initially did not exist. After we `export` it, we can now print the environment variable `$MESSAGE1`.

<img src="/50005-2023/assets/images/lab1/4.png"  class="center_fifty"/>

## $PATH Variable

One of the most important environment variables you’ll work with on the command line is <span style="color:#f7007f;"><b>$PATH</b></span>.

- This is the key to how our shell **knows** which file to execute for commands like cd or echo or other built-in or installed programs.
- The PATH variable provides the <span style="color:#f7007f;"><b>additional context</b></span> that the command line needs to figure out where that particular file is in the system.
- Hence, if you have installed an app (e.g: Telegram) and tried to execute the binary from the command line and met with the error `command not found`, it simply means you haven’t added the path where that binary is to the `$PATH` environment variable.

For example, you can add the **binary** of the **Telegram** app onto the `$PATH` using the command `export`, and now you can simply execute it from anywhere (a new Telegram window is opened on the second Telegram command):

<img src="/50005-2023/assets/images/lab1/5.png"  class="center_seventy"/>

### Task 4

`TASK 4:`{:.info} Examine the value for `$PATH` in your system.

Open that folder (from your Desktop GUI) and navigate to that path. **You may need to enable viewing of hidden files.** If you are using WSL, you need to cd to this path as there’s no GUI. The screenshot below shows the content of `/bin/` directory where some default system programs like `ps, date, pwd, echo,` etc reside:

<img src="/50005-2023/assets/images/lab1/6.png"  class="center_seventy"/>

# Configuring a Terminal Session

The command `export` that modifies the environment variable is only valid for <span style="color:#f7007f;"><b>this</b></span> session. For instance, the Telegram command above will not work anymore if a user opens a new Terminal session (need to `export` again).

To avoid this hassle, there exists a setup script (unique to each shell) that is run whenever a new session starts. This script is typically placed in the user's `home` directory. For instance, `.bashrc` (yes, with this exact name) is a Bash shell script that Bash runs whenever it is started interactively. For Z-shell, this script is called `.zshrc`.

**In short, it initialises an interactive shell session**. You can put **any command** that you could type at the command prompt in that file. It works by being run each time you open up a new terminal, window or pane.

### Task 5

`TASK 5:`{:.info} Adding _Desktop_ to your `$PATH` environment variable **permanently**.

- Go to your home directory: `cd $HOME`
- Create a new file called .bashrc: `touch .bashrc`
- Open the file with any text editor, eg: `nano .bashrc`
- Type: `PATH="$HOME/Desktop:$PATH" `
- Save the file by pressing <span style="color:#f7007f;"><b>CTRL+X</b></span>, and then follow the instruction and press `Enter`
- Restart your session by typing `exec bash`
- Print your `$PATH` using `echo $PATH` command and notice how **Desktop** is now part of your environment variable

```java
bash-3.2$ cd $HOME
bash-3.2$ touch .bashrc
bash-3.2$ nano .bashrc
bash-3.2$ echo $PATH
/Users/natalie_agus/Desktop:...
bash-3.2$
```

# Common Commands

### Shortcut: alias

An `alias` lets you create a **shortcut** name for a command, file name, or any shell text. By using aliases, you save a lot of time when doing tasks you do frequently. You can see current aliases using the `alias` command:

<img src="/50005-2023/assets/images/lab1/7.png"  class="center_seventy"/>

Or **create** an alias:

- `alias name=’command’`
- Example: `alias gst=’git status’`

<img src="/50005-2023/assets/images/lab1/8.png"  class="center_seventy"/>

`alias` is particularly useful when you define them in your shell’s setup script.
{:.info}

### General system usage and statistics

Note that each of the commands below accept **OPTIONS**. Read their manuals for more information using the `man` command.

`man <command>`
{:.warning}
Shows **documentation** of the `<command>` (press q to exit the window after you’re done reading).

`ls <options>`
{:.warning}
Shows the **list of files** in the current directory.

`ps <options>`
{:.warning}
Shows the **list of processes** in the system.

`sudo <command>, sudo apt install <packagename>`
{:.warning}
`sudo` **Executes** the command with **administrative** privileges. `apt` is a **package manager**, it installs packages for **Debian-based Linux distributions**. We can use it to install anything, eg install `node` and `npm`. Using package manager is recommended since you can simply `update` or `remove` (uninstall) it too (`sudo apt remove <packagename>`, etc).

- `sudo apt update`
- `sudo apt install nodejs npm`
- For mac users, you can use [brew](https://brew.sh) as your package manager instead.

`chmod +x <path/to/filename>`
{:.warning}
Make a file **executable**. However, firstly, you need to declare in your script **which interpreter** to use.

- You state the path to this interpreter as the **first line** in your file
- This is called a **shebang**.
  - In Unix-like operating systems, the shebang line provides the **path** to an executable program (e.g. `bash`, `python`) that can interpret the following lines as executable instructions, allowing the user to **run the text file as an executable program** by typing the name of the file directly in the shell **provided the execute permission bit is set**.
- For instance, if this file is a shell script, it should be `#!/bin/sh` or `#!/bin/bash`. If it is a python script, the interpreter should be something like `#!/usr/bin/env python`

`df <options>...`
{:.warning}
Shows the **available disk space** in each partition.

`top`
{:.warning}
**Monitors** processes and system resource usage on Linux.

`ifconfig <options>`
{:.warning}
Displays **information** about all network interfaces currently in operation.

`kill -9 <pid>, pkill <process_name>`
{:.warning}
**Kills** (ends) the process matching the given pid, the same thing happens when you click the close (x) button on the window of a running app.

`ping <servername> <options>`
{:.warning}
**Checks connection** to a server. For example, `ping google.com` tells you whether your connection is active or not.

### File creation and manipulation

Note that each of the commands below accept OPTIONS. Read their manuals for more information using the man command.

`mkdir <dirname>`
{:.warning}
Creates a directory (folder).

`rmdir <dirname>, rm -r <dirname>`
{:.warning}
Deletes an **empty** directory, and the latter removes a directory that contains files. <span style="color:#f7007f;"><b>Be careful!</b></span> Deleting things from the command line doesn’t allow you to retrieve it back. <span style="color:#f7007f;"><b>Unlike deleting from the GUI, it won't be found in the trash</b></span>.

`touch <newfilename.format>`
{:.warning}
**Creates** a new file with whatever name and format you want.

`mv <source> <destination>`
{:.warning}
**Moves** a file from the source path to destination path. Commonly used to **rename** files.

`cp <source> <destination>`
{:.warning}
**Copies** a file from a location to another.

`locate <filename>`
{:.warning}
**Locate** a particular filename in your file system, if you have set it up in the first place. Will return a path to that `<filename>`.

`cat <path/to/filename>`
{:.warning}
**Displays** the **contents** of a file, and

`wc <path/to/filename>`
{:.warning}
**Prints** a **count** of newlines, words, and bytes for each input file.

### Command-Line Text Editor: nano, vim

Command-line text editor provides a handy way to manipulate text files in terminal without the need of installing any other apps. There are a few options, but two of the most popular ones are [nano](https://www.howtogeek.com/howto/42980/the-beginners-guide-to-nano-the-linux-command-line-text-editor/) and [vim](https://opensource.com/article/19/3/getting-started-vim). The latter has a higher learning curve, so we will stick to nano for quick editing.

You can open any created text file using the command:

- `nano <path/to/filename>`
- Then you can start typing as per normal
- Press <span style="color:#f7007f;"><b>Ctrl + X</b></span> to exit, and then **Enter** to save
- You can press **Ctrl + G** as well to bring up the shortcut menu anytime during editing
  <img src="/50005-2023/assets/images/lab1/9.png"  class="center_seventy"/>
- After saving, you can check back the content of the file using the command `cat <path/to/filename>`

## Standard Streams

Standard streams are **input** **and** output communication channels between a <span style="color:#f7007f;"><b>running process</b></span> and its <span style="color:#f7007f;"><b>environment</b></span> when it begins execution. They are **streams** of data that travel from where a program was **executed**, to the places where the program is **processed** and then back again to where the program was **executed**.

The three input/output (I/O) connections are called standard input (stdin), standard output (stdout) and standard error (stderr).
{:.info}

Streams are usually connected to the **terminal** in which they are executed. By default, `stdin` is connected to your **keyboard**, and `stdout + stderr` are directed to your **terminal**. You might be wondering how your keyboard and display then is shared among so many processes? The details require Streams in Linux are treated as though they were files (**Week 6 Material**). E.g: you can **read** text from a file, and you can **write** text into a file. <span style="color:#f7007f;"><b>Both of these actions involve streams of data</b></span>.

When you run a python script, e.g: `python3 playground.py`,

<img src="/50005-2023/assets/images/lab1/10.png"  class="center_seventy"/>
* **Input** from your keyboard is passed from the terminal into the python process, and 
* **Output** from your python process is passed back to your terminal **display**. Here’s a simplified illustration:
<img src="/50005-2023/assets/images/lab1/11.png"  class="center_seventy"/>

Where are these “files” for stdin, stdout, and stderr respectively?

Well, they’re **created** by your OS. You can witness this pretty easily if you run a python script on one terminal (and let it hang there, don’t let it terminate yet! Shown on the right side), find out its process id and then see its details on another terminal (shown on the left) using the `lsof` command.
{:.info}
<img src="/50005-2023/assets/images/lab1/12.png"  class="center_full"/>

You can see in the last three lines that stdin (0u), stdout (1u), and stderr (2u) all point to the file `/dev/ttys004`. **This is the file that is created by the OS and watched by our terminal**.

### Standard output

A standard output is a **default** _place_ (it's just a file actually) for output to go, also known as `stdout`. Your shell is constantly **watching** that output file, and whenever there’s something there, it will automatically print to your screen. For instance, `echo "hello"` is a command that means ”output the string hello to standard output”.

- The process echo prints to `stdout` (probably `/dev/ttyx`),
- ...and your terminal in turn shows it in its GUI display.

### Standard input

The standard input (`stdin`) is a default place where processes listen for information. For example, all the commands above with no other arguments listen for input on `stdin`.
Try typing `cat` on the command line and press enter:

- Notice you can type any character from your keyboard, because it watches for input on `stdin`,
- Then, output what you type to `stdout` (and your shell is watching that output place so it is being printed on your screen), until you type an EOF (end of line) character: `CTRL + d`.

### Standard error

The standard error (`stderr`) is the place where error messages go. Try this command that will prompt an error such as: `cat <inexistent_path/to/filename>`.

What is the output that you see? Similar to stdout, stderr is printed directly to your screen by your shell.
<img src="/50005-2023/assets/images/lab1/13.png"  class="center_fifty"/>

### Stream Redirection

`stdin`, `stdout`, and `stderr` for every process is symbolized with [file descriptor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_descriptor) `0`, `1`, and `2` respectively. Each file associated with a process is allocated a unique number to identify it, this number is called the **file descriptor**.

We can <span style="color:#f7007f;"><b>redirect</b></span> stdin using the `< `operator, stdout using the `>` operator, and stderr using the `2>` operator.

- If we do `<command> > <filename>`, it means we are **redirecting** the `stdout` of `<command>` to the file `<filename>`. That means, we will write whatever that was printed out by the process `<command>` to the file with `<filename>`.
- If we do `<command> < <filename>`, it means that we are **redirecting** the `stdin` of `<command>`, e.g: use the **content** of filename as an **input** to command. This is particularly useful for commands that only take in input streams, and are unable to read the content of a file given a filename.

Note that `stdout` redirection will **truncate** (erase) the original content of the `<filename>`. If you want to append to the **existing** content of file instead, you can use the `>>` operator.
{:.info}

### Task 6

`TASK 6:`{:.info} One example of a program that benefits from stream redirection is `tr`. It is a command line utility for **translating** or **deleting** characters. Do the following:

1. Create a text file with the following content: ”Hello, have a good day today!”, name it `test.txt` and **save** it to your current directory.
2. Then, type the following in the command line (don't forget to navigate to your current directory first using `cd`!): `tr "[a-z]" "[A-Z]" test.txt`
3. You will see such usage suggestion instead:

```java
usage: 	tr [-Ccsu] string1 string2
        tr [-Ccu] -d string1
        tr [-Ccu] -s string1
        tr [-Ccu] -ds string1 string2
```

This is because tr **CANNOT** get input directly from a file. It only reads from `stdin`. 4. Now try` tr "[a-z]" "[A-Z]" < test.txt`. Your console should print ”HELLO, HAVE A GOOD DAY TODAY!”, capitalizing the content of the `test.txt` file (but not changing its content). 5. So based on your observation, can you deduce what is the difference between these two commands:

1.  `tr "[a-z]" "[A-Z]" < test.txt`
2.  `tr "[a-z]" "[A-Z]" test.txt`
3.  Now what if we want to store the capitalized content to another file? Try: `tr "[a-z]" "[A-Z]" < test.txt > new_test.txt`. You should find that “HELLO, HAVE A GOOD DAY TODAY!” exists within `new_test.txt`, since we **redirect** `stdout` to create this new file.
4.  What if we want to write back to `test.txt`? What can you deduce from the output?

Perhaps the screenshot below might help you for steps 1-7 above.
<img src="/50005-2023/assets/images/lab1/14.png"  class="center_seventy"/>

## Pipe

Pipe is a command in Linux that lets you use **two** or **more** commands such that <span style="color:#f7007f;"><b>output</b></span> of one command serves as <span style="color:#f7007f;"><b>input</b></span> to the next.

It may sound similar to stream redirection, but the general rule of thumb is that if you're connecting the output of a command to the input of another command, use a pipe, denoted as `|` symbol. If you are outputting to or from a file use the redirect.
{:.info}

### Task 7

`TASK 7:`{:.info} Try out how to pipe:

1. Suppose we want to pass the output of `cat` command as the input of `sort` command. We can’t do this with redirection:
   <img src="/50005-2023/assets/images/lab1/15.png"  class="center_seventy"/>

2. However, using **pipe** works. It serves as a way to allow **interprocess** communication (Week 3 materials):
   <img src="/50005-2023/assets/images/lab1/16.png"  class="center_seventy"/>

## Download Files using `curl`

The curl command allows us to transfer data (download, upload) online. For instance, we can download the GNU general public license text file using the command:

`curl -o GPL-3 https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.txt`

- The `-o` option: Write output to `<filename>` instead of `stdout`

If you don't have it, install it using `sudo apt install curl`.
{:.warning}

## Output Filtering

One last handy tool to learn is output **filtering**. The [`grep` or `awk`](https://techviewleo.com/awk-vs-grep-vs-sed-commands-in-linux/) command will scan the document for the desired information and present the result in a format you want. The command grep also accepts [regex](https://regexr.com) to search for more complex patterns.

A filter takes input from one command, does some processing, and gives output.
{:.info}

### Task 8

`TASK 8:`{:.info} Suppose we have a long document, that GNU license we downloaded from the task above.

1. To download the license, type the command: `curl -o GPL-3 https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.txt`
2. Now search for a string inside a file using the commands:

- `grep "<string>” <path/to/file>`
- For example: `grep “GNU” GPL-3` prints every line containing “GNU” word.
- Some shells don't require the quotation marks for single-word search, so you can try `grep GNU GPL-3` as well.
  <img src="/50005-2023/assets/images/lab1/17.png"  class="center_seventy"/>

Here are the common grep options to try:

- `-i`: both lower and upper case
- `-v`: search everything that does not contain the `<string>`
- `-n`: prints the line number too

The `<string> `argument of the grep command can accept **regex** too, for instance:

- `grep "^[A-Z]" GPL-3 -n`
- This search for every line starting with **capital** letters
  <img src="/50005-2023/assets/images/lab1/18.png"  class="center_seventy"/>

You can also **pipe** the output of a command to the `grep` command so that you can filter it out. For example, `ps -ax` will report all running processes in your system (by all users, including your own). If we want to filter some processes by name, we can use grep and pipe to filter the Telegram process: `ps -ax | grep -i Telegram`

<img src="/50005-2023/assets/images/lab1/19.png"  class="center_seventy"/>
