When you're confident that your Task 1 and Task 2 are correct, you can run the tester file:

```
python3.10 banker_test.py
```

This will run your `banker.py` against all 6 test cases: q0 to q5. If all goes well, the following message will be printed:

The tester file runs on Windows as well as of 14/06/2023.

It performs a simple output string matching (which is how our autograder works). Therefore it is <span style="color:#f7007f;"><b>crucial</b></span> for you not to print anything else. If you need to debug, <span style="color:#f7007f;"><b>use a debugger</b></span>. Be a proper programmer, it's never too late to start today ðŸ¥³.

# Submission

Once you have completed `Banker.py`, zip that file and submit your answer to our bot. Just type `/start` and follow the instruction there.

Zip can be done easily via the CLI (POSIX-compliant OS). Call this command inside `lab_banker/` directory:

```
zip lab3_submit.zip banker.py
```

<img src="/50005-2023/assets/images/lab3/3.png"  class="center_full"/>

If you don't have `zip`, you shall install it:

```
sudo apt update
sudo apt install zip
```

You need to submit the code by the due date stipulated in the course handout. In the event that the bot is not responsive, you may send your python file `Banker.py` to your UTA with proof (screenshots) of your failed conversation with the bot. They will collate and submit it to our instructor. <span style="color:#f7007f;"><b>Remember</b></span>: only type your answers in the given space. <span style="color:#f7007f;"><b>DO NOT</b></span> print anything else, and <span style="color:#f7007f;"><b>DO NOT</b></span> import any other modules, and <span style="color:#f7007f;"><b>DO NOT</b></span> modify any other instructions.

# Appendix

### How to migrate the .zip file?

Working on a VM and don't know how to migrate your .zip file out to your host OS? You can choose the <span style="color:#f77729;"><b>hard way</b></span> like login to your email account in your VM and then email yourself the zipfile. Or, login to Telegram in your VM.

If you're using VirtualBox, you can also enable shared clipboard:

But why do that? Why do that if you're a CS student? Use `ssh`!
{:.info}

### ssh

You can enable `ssh` at your VM, [here](https://dev.to/developertharun/easy-way-to-ssh-into-virtualbox-machine-any-os-just-x-steps-5d9i) is a guide if you're using VirtualBox. Or, you can simply Google "ssh to your-virtual-machine" and follow simple steps there. Then, enable ssh on `VSCode`: install the `ssh` extension and connect! You can follow the guide [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/ssh-tutorial) just this part:

<img src="/50005-2023/assets/images/lab3/4.png"  class="center_seventy"/>

Then, type in your VM address when prompted in this format: `ssh -p <port_number> <username>@<local_ip>`, for example:

```
ssh -p 3022 ubuntu@127.0.0.1
```

You will need to then enter your password. Then click `Open Folder` and select your Home folder. You will have a nice interface with VSCode now, connected to your VM. Drag and drop to transfer files between your host OS and your VM. No lag, nice terminal, can utilise VSCode functionalities.. Doesn't it spark joy?
