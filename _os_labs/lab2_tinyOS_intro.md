In this lab, you are tasked to write an I/O interrupt handler (**asynchronous** interrupt) and an I/O supervisor call (**synchronous** interrupt) for a very simple OS called the TinyOS using the Beta assembly language that you have learned from 50002 last term. This is closely related to what we have learned last week regarding [hardware interrupt](https://natalieagus.github.io/50005/os_notes/week1_resource#hardware-interrupt) and [system call](https://natalieagus.github.io/50005/os_notes/week2_syscall) as part of Operating System services.

This lab is also closely related to your 50002 materials. In particular, the lecture notes on [Virtual Machine](https://natalieagus.github.io/50002/notes/virtualmachine), and [Asynchronous handling of I/O Devices](https://natalieagus.github.io/50002/notes/asyncio) are closely related to this lab.

## Checkoff and Lab Questionnaire

You are required to finish the lab questionnaire on eDimension and complete two `CHECKOFF`{:.info} during this session. Simply show that your bsim simulates the desirable checkoff outcome for Part A and Part B (binary grading, either you complete it or you don't) of the lab. Read along to find out more.

There will be **no makeup slot** for checkoff for this lab. If you miss the class in Week 2 with no LOA, you get zero. If you have LOA, show it to our TAs and you can checkoff during the following Week's Lab session or at the TA's discretion.

## Introduction: The Tiny OS

Enter the following to your terminal to clone the Tiny OS repository and open the directory.

```
git clone https://github.com/natalieagus/lab-tinyOS.git
```

You will find a few files: `bsim.jar, beta.uasm, tinyOS.uasm`. You should know what the first two are from 50002 (yes, its the same Beta simulator we used before). `tinyOS.uasm` is a program that implements a minimal Kernel supporting a simple **timesharing** system. Use BSim to load this file, assemble, and then run `tinyOS.uasm`. The following prompt should appear in the console pane of the BSim Display Window:

<img src="/50005-2023/assets/contentimage/lab6/1.png"  class=" center_seventy"/>

As you type, each character is echoed to the console and when you hit **return** the whole sentence is translated into Pig Latin and written to the console:

<img src="/50005-2023/assets/contentimage/lab6/2.png"  class=" center_seventy"/>

The hex number `0x000711BC` written out in the screenshot above as part of the prompt is a **count** of the **number of times** one of the user-mode processes (**Process 2**) has been **scheduled** while you typed in the sentence or leave the program idling.

This program implements a primitive OS kernel for the Beta along with **three** simple user-mode processes hooked together thru a semaphore-controlled bounded buffer. The three processes -- and the kernel -- **share an address space**; each is allocated its own stack (for a total of 4 stacks), and each process has its own virtual machine state (ie, registers). The latter is stored in the kernel `ProcTbl`, which contains a **data structure** for each process.

Before we start, it is useful to open `beta.uasm` and familiarise yourself with some convenient macros, namely:

```nasm
.macro CALL(label)	BR(label, LP)

.macro RTN()		JMP(LP)
.macro XRTN()		JMP(XP)
```

and privileged mode instructions to interact with the system I/O and other functionalities:

```nasm
.macro PRIV_OP(FNCODE)		betaopc (0x00, 0, FNCODE, 0)
.macro HALT() PRIV_OP (0)
.macro RDCHAR() PRIV_OP (1)
.macro WRCHAR() PRIV_OP (2)
.macro CYCLE()	PRIV_OP (3)
.macro TIME()	PRIV_OP (4)
.macro CLICK()	PRIV_OP (5)
.macro RANDOM()	PRIV_OP (6)
.macro SEED()	PRIV_OP (7)
.macro SERVER() PRIV_OP (8)
```

For instance, `WRCHAR()` will print a single character to the terminal. this is implemented in Java (you can find it in MIT's 6.004 bsim's source code). Here's a snippet of it:

```java
  switch (inst & 0xFFFF) { // look at the last 16 bits of the instruction
    case 0: // halt
      ...
    case 1: // rdchar: return char in regs[0] or loop
      ...
      break dispatch;
    case 2: // wrchar: print char in regs[0]
      if (tty) {
        usertty.append(String.valueOf((char) regs[0]));
        try {
          usertty.setCaretPosition(usertty.getText().length() - 1);
        } catch (Exception e) {
        }
        Thread.yield();
      } else
        Trap(ILLOP);
      break dispatch;
    case 3: // cycle: return current cycle count in regs[0]
      ...
```

### Supervisor Mode

All kernel code is executed with the Kernel-mode bit of the program counter -- its highest-order bit (MSB) --- set. This causes new interrupt requests to be **deferred** until the kernel returns to user mode.

### Checkoff and Lab Questionnaire

You are required to finish the lab questionnaire on eDimension and complete two `CHECKOFF`{:.info} during this session. Simply show that your bsim simulates the desirable checkoff outcome for Part A and Part B (binary grading, either you complete it or you don't) of the lab. Read along to find out more.

## Asynchronous Interrupts

`tinyOS.uasm` implements the following functionality to support Asynchronous Interrupts:

### Vectored Interrupt Routine

Kernel-mode **vector interrupt routine** for handling input from the keyboard, clock, reset, and illegal instruction (trap).

```nasm
||| Interrupt vectors:

. = VEC_RESET
	BR(I_Reset)	| on Reset (start-up)
. = VEC_II
	BR(I_IllOp)	| on Illegal Instruction (eg SVC)
. = VEC_CLK
	BR(I_Clk)	| On Clock interrupt
. = VEC_KBD
	BR(I_Kbd)	| on Keyboard interrupt
. = VEC_MOUSE
	BR(I_BadInt)	| on Mouse interrupt
```

### Keyboard Interrupt Handling

A keyboard key press causes the asynchronous interrupt to occur, which results in the execution of a keyboard interrupt handler labelled `I_Kbd`. Incoming characters are stored in a kernel buffer called `Key_State` for subsequent use by user-mode programs.

```nasm
Key_State: LONG(0)			| 1-char keyboard buffer.

I_Kbd:	ENTER_INTERRUPT()		| Adjust the PC!
	ST(r0, UserMState)		| Save ONLY r0...
	RDCHAR()			| Read the character,
	ST(r0,Key_State)		| save its code.
	LD(UserMState, r0)		| restore r0, and
	JMP(xp)				| and return to the user.
```

### Reset Handling

```nasm
I_Reset:
	CMOVE(P0Stack, SP)
	CMOVE(P0Start, XP)
	JMP(XP)
```

Upon startup, we will begin executing Process 0, which instruction address resides at address with label `P0Start`.

### Clock Interrupt Handling

The clock interrupt **invokes** the scheduler asynchronously. Each compute-bound process gets a quantum consisting of TICS clock interrupts, where **TICS** is the number stored in the variable Tics below. To avoid overhead, we do a full state save only when the clock interrupt will cause a process swap, using the TicsLeft variable as a counter.

We do a LIMITED state save (R0 only) in order to free up a register, then reduce TicsLeft by 1. When it becomes negative, we do a FULL state save and call the scheduler; otherwise we just return, having burned only a few clock cycles on the interrupt. RECALL that the call to Scheduler sets TicsLeft to Tics, giving the newly-swapped-in process a **full** quantum.

```nasm
Tics:	LONG(2)			| Number of clock interrupts/quantum.
TicsLeft: LONG(0)		| Number of tics left in this quantum

I_Clk:	ENTER_INTERRUPT()	| Adjust the PC!
	ST(r0, UserMState)	| Save R0 ONLY, for now.
	LD(TicsLeft, r0)	| Count down TicsLeft
	SUBC(r0,1,r0)
	ST(r0, TicsLeft)	| Now there's one left.
	CMPLTC(r0, 0, r0)	| If new value is negative, then
	BT(r0, DoSwap)		|   swap processes.
	LD(UserMState, r0)	| Else restore r0, and
	JMP(XP)			| return to same user.

DoSwap:	LD(UserMState, r0)	| Restore r0, so we can do a
	SAVESTATE()		|   FULL State save.
	LD(KStack, SP)		| Install kernel stack pointer.
	CALL(Scheduler)		| Swap it out!
	BR(I_Rtn)		| and return to next process.
```

## Synchronous Interrupts

`tinyOS.uasm` implements a few functionalities to support Synchronous Interrupts (also known as _trap_ or _supervisor call_). **Kernel-mode supervisor call** dispatching and a repertoire of call handlers that provide simple I/O services to user-mode programs include:

1. `Halt()` – **stop** a user-mode process (equivalent to closing or killing the process)
2. `WrMsg()` – write a null-terminated `ASCII` string to the console
3. `WrCh()` – write the `ASCII` character found in `R0` to the console
4. `GetKey()` – return the next `ASCII` character from the keyboard in `R0`; this call **does not return** to the user (blocks) **until there is a character available.**
5. `HexPrt()` – convert the value passed in R0 to a hexadecimal string and output it to the console.
6. `Yield()` – immediately **schedule** the next user-mode program for execution. Execution will resume in the usual fashion when the round-robin scheduler chooses this process again.

### Implementing SVC

Supervisor calls are actually **unimplemented** instructions that cause the expected trap when executed. Any illegal instruction will cause the ILLOP handler to be executed:

```nasm
I_IllOp:
	SAVESTATE()		| Save the machine state.
	LD(KStack, SP)		| Install kernel stack pointer.

	LD(XP, -4, r0)		| Fetch the illegal instruction
	SHRC(r0, 26, r0)	| Extract the 6-bit OPCODE, SVC opcode is 000001 (second element of the table)
	SHLC(r0, 2, r0)		| Make it a WORD (4-byte) index
	LD(r0, UUOTbl, r0)	| Fetch UUOTbl[OPCODE]
	JMP(r0)			| and dispatch to the UUO handler.


.macro UUO(ADR) LONG(ADR+PC_SUPERVISOR)	| Auxiliary Macros
.macro BAD()	UUO(UUOError)

UUOTbl:	BAD()		UUO(SVC_UUO)	BAD()		BAD()
	BAD()		BAD()		BAD()		BAD()
	BAD()		BAD()		BAD()		BAD()
	BAD()		BAD()		BAD()		BAD()
	BAD()		BAD()		BAD()		BAD()
	BAD()		BAD()		BAD()		BAD()
	BAD()		BAD()		BAD()		BAD()
	BAD()		BAD()		BAD()		BAD()
	BAD()		BAD()		BAD()		BAD()
	BAD()		BAD()		BAD()		BAD()
	BAD()		BAD()		BAD()		BAD()
	BAD()		BAD()		BAD()		BAD()
	BAD()		BAD()		BAD()		BAD()
	BAD()		BAD()		BAD()		BAD()
	BAD()		BAD()		BAD()		BAD()
	BAD()		BAD()		BAD()		BAD()
....
```

Kernel code should reside in the memory region with MSB of 1, as per Beta's way of setting Kernel mode. However, note that BSim memory is not actually 4GB in size. The `UUOTbl` actually resides in address `0x054C`:

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}//assets/images/lab2_tinyOS_intro/2023-05-14-20-24-40.png"  class="center_seventy"/>

To work around this, we use the macro `.macro UUO(ADR) LONG(ADR+PC_SUPERVISOR)	| Auxiliary Macros`, which simply adds MSB of 1 in the **content** of the `UUOTbl`, which makes the `PC` to be in Supervisor mode when we execute `JMP(r0)` to **dispatch** the UUO handler.

The illegal instruction trap handler looks for illegal instructions it knows to be supervisor calls and calls the appropriate handler defined in `SVC_UUO`, which makes use of the `SVC_Tbl` to branch to the appropriate trap **handler** based on the service call being made:

```nasm
SVC_UUO:
	LD(XP, -4, r0)		| The faulting instruction.
	ANDC(r0,0x7,r0)		| Pick out low bits,
	SHLC(r0,2,r0)		| make a word index,
	LD(r0,SVCTbl,r0)	| and fetch the table entry.
	JMP(r0)

SVCTbl:	UUO(HaltH)		| SVC(0): User-mode HALT instruction
	UUO(WrMsgH)		| SVC(1): Write message
	UUO(WrChH)		| SVC(2): Write Character
	UUO(GetKeyH)		| SVC(3): Get Key
	UUO(HexPrtH)		| SVC(4): Hex Print
	UUO(WaitH)		| SVC(5): Wait(S) ,,, S in R3
	UUO(SignalH)		| SVC(6): Signal(S), S in R3
	UUO(YieldH)		| SVC(7): Yield()
```

The translation between `SVC(0)` to `Halt()`, `SVC(1)` to `WrMsg()` and so on is declared as `macros` to interface with the Kernel code.

```nasm
||| Definitions of macros used to interface with Kernel code:

.macro Halt()	SVC(0)		| Stop a process.

.macro WrMsg()	SVC(1)		| Write the 0-terminated msg following SVC
.macro WrCh()	SVC(2)		| Write a character whose code is in R0

.macro GetKey()	SVC(3)		| Read a key from the keyboard into R0
.macro HexPrt()	SVC(4)		| Hex Print the value in R0.

.macro Yield()	SVC(7)		| Give up remaining quantum
```

Note that this is just for **convenience**. The macro declarations are made so that we can conveniently write `Halt()` as part of our instruction instead of the more unintuitive version of it, e.g: `SVC(0)`.

### Halt Handler

The `Halt()` handler is implemented as follows:

```nasm
HaltH:	BR(I_Wait)			| SVC(0): User-mode HALT SVC
```

It **pauses** the current execution of the calling process, then forces the CPU to execute `I_Wait`, which contains a routine to call the scheduler and therefore schedule other processes (if it exists). You will learn more about process scheduling in the weeks to come.

### Write Message and Write Char Handler

The `WrMsg()` is equivalent to a regular `print` statement. Its purpose is to print a 0-terminated message. We can define a string immediately following the `WrMsg()` instruction. Execution resumes with the instruction following the string as such:

```nasm
WrMsg()
.text “This text is sent to the console…\n”
* …next instruction…
```

The handler is implemented as follows:

```nasm
WrMsgH:	LD(UserMState+(4*30), r0)	| Fetch interrupted XP, then
	CALL(KMsgAux)			| print text following SVC.
	ST(r0,UserMState+(4*30))	| Store updated XP.
	BR(I_Rtn)
```

It calls an Auxiliary routine for sending message to the console. This routine must be called while in **supervisor mode**. On entry, R0 should point to data; on return, R0 holds next longword **aligned** location after data.

```nasm
KMsgAux:
	PUSH(r1)
	PUSH(r2)
	PUSH(r3)
	PUSH(r4)

	MOVE (R0, R1)

WrWord:	LD (R1, 0, R2)		| Fetch a 4-byte word into R2
	ADDC (R1, 4, R1)	| Increment word pointer
	CMOVE(4,r3)		| Byte/word counter

WrByte:	ANDC(r2, 0x7F, r0)	| Grab next byte -- LOW end first!
	BEQ(r0, WrEnd)		| Zero byte means end of text.
	WRCHAR()		| Print it.
	SRAC(r2,8,r2)		| Shift out this byte
	SUBC(r3,1,r3)		| Count down... done with this word?
	BNE(r3,WrByte)		| Nope, continue.
	BR(WrWord)		| Yup, on to next.

WrEnd:
	MOVE (R1, R0)
	POP(r4)
	POP(r3)
	POP(r2)
	POP(r1)
	RTN()
```

When the routine returns back to `WrMsgH()`, it will return to the calling user process and resume its execution.

`WrChH()` works similarly, but in this case we just print out 1 character that we have put in `R0` so we don't have to go through the whole ordeal of "loading a string" from the regs to be printed on screen.

```nasm
WrChH:	LD(UserMState,r0)		| The user's <R0>
	WRCHAR()			| Write out the character,
	BR(I_Rtn)			| then return
```

### GetKey Handler

The purpose of this handler is to read a single keystroke from the `Key_State`, a dedicated space in the Kernel to hold the current keystroke into `R0` so that the calling user process can use it.

```nasm
Key_State: LONG(0)			| 1-char keyboard buffer.

GetKeyH:				| return key code in r0, or block
	LD(Key_State, r0)
	BEQ(r0, I_Wait)			| on 0, just wait a while

| key ready, return it and clear the key buffer
	LD(Key_State, r0)		| Fetch character to return
	ST(r0,UserMState)		| return it in R0.
	ST(r31, Key_State)		| Clear kbd buffer
	BR(I_Rtn)			| and return to user.
```

### HexPrt Handler

Similar to `WrCh()`, we print the value placed in `R0` in hex form (instead of char form).

```nasm
HexPrtH:
	LD(UserMState,r0)		| Load user R0
	CALL(KHexPrt)			| Print it out
	BR(I_Rtn)			| And return to user
```

`KHexPrt` is a hex print procedure defined as follows. It goes through the 32-bit word stored at R0, and process it nybble (half a byte) by nybble.

```nasm
HexDig:	LONG('0') LONG('1') LONG('2') LONG('3') LONG('4') LONG('5')
	LONG('6') LONG('7') LONG('8') LONG('9') LONG('A') LONG('B')
	LONG('C') LONG('D') LONG('E') LONG('F')

KHexPrt:
	PUSH(r0)		| Saves all regs, incl r0
	PUSH(r1)
	PUSH(r2)
	PUSH(lp)

	CMOVE(8, r2)
	MOVE(r0,r1)
KHexPr1:
	SRAC(r1,28,r0)			| Extract digit into r0.
	MULC(r1, 16, r1)		| Next loop, next nybble...
	ANDC(r0, 0xF, r0)
	MULC(r0, 4, r0)
	LD(r0, HexDig, r0)
	WRCHAR ()
	SUBC(r2,1,r2)
	BNE(r2,KHexPr1)

	POP(lp)
	POP(r2)
	POP(r1)
	POP(r0)
	RTN()
```

### Yield Handler

Finally, a `Yield()` is called when a user process wants to give up the remaining quanta so that other process can be scheduled.

```nasm
YieldH: CALL(Scheduler)		| Schedule next process, and
	BR(I_Rtn)		| and return to user.
```

Processes are given equal time slices called quanta (or quantums) takes turns of one quantum each. if a process finishes early, before its quantum expires, the next process starts immediately and gets a full quantum.

## User Programs

`tinyOS.uasm` also contains code for <span style="color:red; font-weight: bold;">three</span> user programs named `P0, P1`, and `P2`. They're located towards the end of `tinyOS.uasm`. We will not dive in too deep about who each user programs is scheduled (that will be for another lab). For now, here's all the information you need:

1. `P0`: Prompts the user for new lines of input and store the input
2. `P1`: Converts the given input into piglatin and printing it back to the terminal
3. `P2`: Increments an internal counter and `Yield()`. Thanks to `P2`, you can see some numbers printed at the prompt
