The `traceroute` utility is another useful network utility. It enables you to trace the route taken by a packet from your machine to a remote host.

Note that if traceroute doesn’t work on your VM, you may:

- Add the `-I` option: `traceroute -I [ip]`
- Or, use results from `tracert` (assuming Windows is your host OS).

Here is an example of the output produced when traceroute is used to trace the route taken by a packet to www.mit.edu:

<img src="/50005-2023/assets/images/nslab1/1.png"  class="center_seventy"/>

The first line of the traceroute output describes what the command is set for.

- It lists the <span style="color:#f77729;"><b>destination</b></span> system (e9566.dscb.akamaiedge.net), destination IP address (184.50.104.236), and the maximum number of hops that will be used in the traceroute (64).

The remainder of the output shows information on <span style="color:#f77729;"><b>each hop</b></span>, where each line is a reply from (typically) a router, _in the path between the sender and the final destination_.

> It is <span style="color:#f77729;"><b>important</b></span> to note that the number of hops isn’t an important factor that affects latency.

Each of these lines begins with a host (e.g router) <span style="color:#f77729;"><b>IP</b></span> on the route from your computer to www.mit.edu, followed by the round-trip time (<span style="color:#f77729;"><b>RTT</b></span>) for <span style="color:#f7007f;"><b>3</b></span> packets sent to that host.

For more information about `traceroute`, you can look up its manual page by running `man traceroute` from the command line.

### Task 4

`TASK 4:`{:.info} Find out how `traceroute` works. You will need this to answer several questions on eDimension.

> Hint: `traceroute` sends a UDP packet to the destination host's (highly likely) _unusable_ port, with increasing TTL. The routers that reduces the TTL to 0 will send an ICMP TTL Exceeded reply. The end host will send an ICMP Port unreachable reply.

## Route Asymmetries

The route taken to send a packet from your machine to the remote host machine is <span style="color:#f77729;"><b>not always the same</b></span> with the route taken to send a packet from the remote machine _back_ to you.

In this exercise, you will run traceroute in two <span style="color:#f77729;"><b>opposite</b></span> directions. First, you will run `traceroute` on a remote host to see the route taken <span style="color:#f77729;"><b>to your network</b></span>. Then, you will also run `traceroute` from your computer to see the route taken to that host.

### Task 5

`TASK 5:`{:.info} Find out your computer’s public IP address. (Hint: You can use a website like [this](http://www.whatismypublicip.com/), or search for “what is my ip” using Google’s search engine.)

### Task 6

`TASK 6:`{:.info} Visit [this link](https://www.uptrends.com/tools/traceroute) in your web browser.

- Enter your computer’s public IP address,
- Select the “from Location”, and follow the steps shown in site for at least <span style="color:#f7007f;"><b>three</b></span> locations namely: New York, Amsterdam, Tokyo.
- Then, click “Start Test” to start a traceroute to your computer.
- Take a <span style="color:#f77729;"><b>screenshot</b></span> of the output

> If the output shows that the packet _does not reach your IP_ (request timed out), think about a reason or two on why this is so.

### Task 7

`TASK 7:`{:.info} After `traceroute` finishes running, you should be able to view the route taken from <span style="color:#f77729;"><b>specified locations</b></span> to your network.

- Record the IP address of the <span style="color:#f77729;"><b>first</b></span> hop (hop 1), which will be used in the next step.

In the screenshot below, that will be 31.204.145.131 for example.

You’re free to use other similar sites if [the site suggested above](https://www.uptrends.com/tools/traceroute) is blocked in your network, or if you have two devices with different IPs (e.g: one uses VPN), then you can also traceroute each other’s IP addresses.
{:.warning}

You can <span style="color:#f77729;"><b>check</b></span> who that remote host is using the command `whois [ip address]`, for instance, 31.204.145.131 is indeed described as being in Tokyo.

### Task 8

`TASK 8:`{:.info} On your computer, run `traceroute` using the IP address recorded in the previous step as the remote destination.

For instance,

## Final Thoughts

Is there anything _unusual_ in the output of **Task 8**? Are the <span style="color:#f77729;"><b>same</b></span> routers traversed in both directions?

> If no, why so?
